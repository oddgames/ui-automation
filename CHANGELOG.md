# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.186] - 2026-08-11

### Changed
- iOS reports no longer block the calling thread. Report assembly (video ring dump + gzip of the whole session log ring, up to 16 MB) ran synchronously — on the main queue for the report form, and on the exception's own thread for auto-reported exceptions — so the game froze for the whole remux + zip before a single byte was sent. Both paths now assemble on a background queue. Safe for the severe cases because a real crash / OOM is written to disk by the signal handler and drained on next launch, so they never depended on this path finishing; managed exceptions don't kill the process. The sticky upload banner is now raised when a submit STARTS (past the early-return guards, so it can't be orphaned) rather than when the manifest is queued, so the 'still sending' state covers assembly too instead of a toast fading into silence.

## [0.8.185] - 2026-08-11

### Changed
- Hands-free tester reporting: Bugpunch.StartRecording() starts the capture ring with no consent sheet, no profile picker and no login, for alpha builds that should record continuously; Bugpunch.SetReportTriggers(shake, screenshot) lets a tester raise a report by shaking the device or taking a screenshot, landing on the same report form (and same screenshot/video/logs) as the debug widget's Report button. Reports work signed-out — attributed to the device. Shake: CoreMotion (iOS) / SensorManager (Android), 2.2g crossed twice within 600ms, 3s cooldown. Screenshot: full support on iOS; Android needs API 34+ (registerScreenCaptureCallback), silently unavailable below that. Managed lane (Editor/Standalone) is a deliberate no-op — no device sensors.

## [0.8.184] - 2026-08-06

### Changed
- fix Android GLES video/crash-frame capture recording black on some drivers (Pixel 9 Pro XL/Mali-G715): RenderTexture.GetNativeTexturePtr returns a name that is not the storage ScreenCapture writes, so native now owns the handoff texture (share-group alloc in bp_gpu.c) and C# copies the screenshot RT into it via Graphics.CopyTexture; probe-driven self-heal recreates a dead handoff, and a session whose input stays black is declared capture_black — the ring refuses to dump, so reports carry an honest placeholder instead of megabytes of black MP4

## [0.8.183] - 2026-08-06

### Changed
- fix Editor 'Missing Profiler.EndSample' spam: IDE /capture and the F12 dialog preview captured the backbuffer mid-frame, forcing a synchronous GameView repaint that closed the profiler frame inside the editor GUI sample stack — both now capture inside the end-of-frame callback (and skip a redundant game-view re-render per screenshot)

## [0.8.182] - 2026-08-04

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fail an iOS Simulator player build up front, with a message that names Bugpunch. Bugpunch.xcframework ships a single ios-arm64 device slice, so on a Simulator build Unity's ProcessXCFramework resolves nothing into BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR and the build died much later at link time — first on the -force_load added by PostProcessBuild_iOS ("ld: file not found: .../libBugpunch.a"), and underneath that on undefined _Bugpunch_* symbols from the __Internal P/Invokes, which no link-flag tweak resolves without a simulator slice. Neither error mentions Bugpunch, leaving the failure untraceable to its cause. BugpunchIosSimulatorGuard (IPreprocessBuildWithReport at callbackOrder int.MinValue) now throws BuildFailedException pointing straight at Player Settings > Other Settings > Target SDK.
- sdk(release): the distribution pre-clean now DISCOVERS loadable plugin directories instead of hardcoding two paths. Any .androidlib / .bundle / .framework / .plugin / .xcframework added on any lane is covered the day it lands, mirroring PLUGIN_DIR_EXTS in preflight.cjs. Each pre-cleaned dir is also Verify-Mirror'd unconditionally now: the wipe does not care which lanes rebuilt this run, so a copy that silently failed to restore one would otherwise have reached the release commit as a deletion.
- sdk(release): verify the Android bugpunch_sso.androidlib.meta GUID anchor at release time, matching the iOS Bugpunch.xcframework.meta check that already existed. A loadable plugin directory's sibling .meta is its only AssetDatabase identity — it carries the stable GUID and the PluginImporter platform gating (Android-only / iOS-only, Any=0). Lose it and Unity regenerates a default: new random GUID, default platform settings, silently relinking a native plugin on platforms it must never ship to.

## [0.8.181] - 2026-08-04

### Changed
- sdk(ios): ship Bugpunch.xcframework device-only (ios-arm64). The ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator slice was never linked into a device build — Unity's ProcessXCFramework resolves only the matching slice, and the -force_load in PostProcessBuild_iOS points at that resolved archive — so it cost nothing at runtime but shipped to every consumer: 8.9 MB of dead weight. xcframework 14 MB -> 4.6 MB, package 24 MB -> 15 MB. We build and test device-only; simulator builds gave misleading results (recordings with perf counters but no method-profiler timings).
- sdk(release): distribution sync now propagates deletions. xcopy only adds and overwrites, so a file dropped from package/ lived on in the distribution repo forever, and Verify-Mirror only checked package->dist — a release shipping a retired artifact reported success. The two directory-shaped artifacts (Bugpunch.xcframework, bugpunch_sso.androidlib) are now wiped before the copy, and Verify-Mirror fails on any entry present in dist but absent from package. A blanket mirror stays off the table: the dist repo root carries .git / README / LICENSE that package/ does not.
- sdk(android): drop legacy .meta files from inside bugpunch_sso.androidlib. Unity has refused to create .meta files inside loadable plugin directories since 2023.1.0a24 and ignores existing ones at build time, but preflight's single-import-unit rule was special-cased to .xcframework — so it was actively demanding the three Android ones. That rule now covers all five loadable plugin directory types (.androidlib, .bundle, .framework, .plugin, .xcframework), so no lane can drift back.

## [0.8.180] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- Android GLES video capture: fix black/garbage recordings — the RT native texture ptr was cached at Create() (GLES creates RT storage lazily on the render thread), now fetched after the first capture and re-fetched on app resume (BugpunchGpuCapture + BugpunchCrashRetain — the crash-frame retain had the same bug, blanking crash screenshots)
- Capture-health probe (bp_probe.c, GLES + Vulkan lanes): samples the real encoder input → videoMeta.captureHealth (static/black/garbage verdicts) + one WARN in the captured log ring
- Remuxer STARVATION warn is now frame-rate-based (Android + iOS) — no longer false-fires on any session shorter than the rolling window
- Dump-time capture-stall detector (Android + iOS): warns when the newest ring sample is >5s older than the dump / UI-pause start (truncated-clip post-mortems, sdk#91)
- iOS: BPLOG lines now tee into the captured log ring — NSLog is os_log-only on device, so uploaded reports carried none of the SDK's own diagnostics
- UIToolkit managed-lane dialogs: centralized PrepareRoot + ThemeStyleSheet, replacing per-surface font workarounds (sdk#90)

## [0.8.179] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- Android GLES video capture: fix black/garbage recordings — the RT native texture ptr was cached at Create() (GLES creates RT storage lazily on the render thread), now fetched after the first capture and re-fetched on app resume (BugpunchGpuCapture + BugpunchCrashRetain — the crash-frame retain had the same bug, blanking crash screenshots)
- Capture-health probe (bp_probe.c, GLES + Vulkan lanes): samples the real encoder input → videoMeta.captureHealth (static/black/garbage verdicts) + one WARN in the captured log ring
- Remuxer STARVATION warn is now frame-rate-based (Android + iOS) — no longer false-fires on any session shorter than the rolling window

- UIToolkit managed-lane dialogs: centralized PrepareRoot + ThemeStyleSheet, replacing per-surface font workarounds (sdk#90)

## [0.8.178] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- UIToolkit managed-lane dialogs: centralized PrepareRoot + ThemeStyleSheet, replacing per-surface font workarounds (sdk#90)

## [0.8.177] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- Android GLES video capture: fix black/garbage recordings — the RT native texture ptr was cached at Create() (GLES creates RT storage lazily on the render thread), now fetched after the first capture and re-fetched on app resume (BugpunchGpuCapture + BugpunchCrashRetain — the crash-frame retain had the same bug, blanking crash screenshots)

- UIToolkit managed-lane dialogs: centralized PrepareRoot + ThemeStyleSheet, replacing per-surface font workarounds (sdk#90)

## [0.8.176] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- sdk(editor): F12 video captures the whole game view instead of a crop — the ring encoder now fits the live source aspect inside the requested box and box-filters frames into it, where before a hardcoded 1280x720 target read the top-left 1280x720 pixels of a 1080p game view
- sdk(editor): F12 video records game audio — an AudioListener tap (Editor peer of the runtime BugpunchAudioTap) pushes the final mix into a PCM ring that is AAC-encoded and interleaved into the mp4 at dump time
- sdk(editor): ring video PTS is wall-clock rather than frame-count, so dropped frames no longer compress real time or desync the audio track
- sdk(editor): uploads carry the ring's real encoder dimensions instead of a constant 1280x720
- sdk(editor): rebuild the D3D staging texture when the game view resizes — CopyResource silently failed on a size change and the ring kept encoding the last frame that fit
- sdk(editor): drop the guard that skipped capture entirely when the game view was smaller than the ring target
- sdk(build): build-odd-recorder.ps1 handed a multi-line string to cmd /c, which keeps only the first line — vcvars ran, cl never did, and the build exited 0 without producing a DLL

## [0.8.175] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- sdk(ios): reject export-only (stripped) UnityFramework symbol table in the dSYM upload hook — skip the upload and emit a visible Xcode warning instead of silently uploading an exports-only table that masks the build as symbolicated and mis-resolves every IL2CPP frame to a bogus nearest-export name.

## [0.8.174] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- Fix Debug Tools board rows compressing instead of scrolling (UIToolkit flex-shrink on ScrollView list children)

## [0.8.173] - 2026-07-22

### Changed
- fix(ios): native crashes with a stray NUL byte no longer upload frameless — Bugpunch_ReadCrashFile read the .crash report via strlen, truncating at the first NUL (before ---STACK---), so the server skipped symbolication and ~7% of iOS native crashes landed with no symbols. Now copies the full UTF-8 length and strips embedded NULs so the stack survives and symbolication runs. Android/C# already NUL-safe (length-based string reads).
- bundled in-flight: F12 scene-hierarchy attachment (HierarchyAttachment), Editor quick-task dialog/hotkey/runner, iOS symbol-upload hook, build-stamp refresh.

## [0.8.172] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- iOS symbol upload: guarantee UnityFramework.dSYM is generated so iOS crashes symbolicate. The build hook now forces DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT=dwarf-with-dsym on the UnityFramework target (Unity leaves it on plain 'dwarf', so no dSYM was produced and only the near-useless app-shell + FBSDK dSYMs uploaded — every iOS crash came back as raw UnityFramework+0x…). Added a dsymutil Run-Script fallback that rebuilds UnityFramework.dSYM from the linked binary if it's still missing at archive time, plus a loud warning when the UnityFramework Xcode target can't be resolved.

## [0.8.171] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- sdk: player report-context rides along with each chat message — identity + linked accounts, custom data (SetTag/SetContext), and the report attachment-rule files (glob-expanded) attach to the chat send on every lane (C#/Java/iOS); the server stores it on the thread and the dashboard shows it in the chat panel
- sdk: revert the separate chat data/file concept from v0.8.170 — AddChatFile and the gamestate request kind are removed; files support can pull are the existing AddAttachmentRule allow-list, pulled via the existing file request

## [0.8.170] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- sdk: support chat game state + file pulls — new gamestate request kind (scene, SetTag/SetContext state, linked accounts, declared files), Bugpunch.AddChatFile(label, path), and file requests now upload the whole file (≤25MB) into the chat as a download chip
- sdk: SetTag now mirrors into the C# store on every lane (was managed-only) so chat/managed readers see game tags on device
- sdk: every report carries diskFreeMB/diskTotalMB (Android StatFs, iOS ImportantUsage capacity, managed DriveInfo) — makes disk-full write failures diagnosable
- sdk: staging writers (HierarchyAttachment, ContextObjectCapture, AttachmentRuleRunner) surface the real create-failure reason instead of a downstream DirectoryNotFoundException
- sdk: Editor uploads manual reports + feedback; auto error events stay Editor-suppressed

## [0.8.169] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- sdk: support chat game state + file pulls — new gamestate request kind (scene, SetTag/SetContext state, linked accounts, declared files), Bugpunch.AddChatFile(label, path), and file requests now upload the whole file (≤25MB) into the chat as a download chip
- sdk: SetTag now mirrors into the C# store on every lane (was managed-only) so chat/managed readers see game tags on device
- sdk: every report carries diskFreeMB/diskTotalMB (Android StatFs, iOS ImportantUsage capacity, managed DriveInfo) — makes disk-full write failures diagnosable
- sdk: staging writers (HierarchyAttachment, ContextObjectCapture, AttachmentRuleRunner) surface the real create-failure reason instead of a downstream DirectoryNotFoundException
- sdk: Editor uploads manual reports + feedback; auto error events stay Editor-suppressed

## [0.8.168] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- logs: reports attach the ENTIRE session — 16 MB log rings on all lanes (was 1 MB ring windowed to 500 KB start + 500 KB tail, ~one video's worth at typical rates)
- logs: report path streams the ring into gzip in 256 KB chunks (no ring-sized allocations — safe on soft-OOM reports); crash drains gzip their log dumps before upload
- logs(ios): prev-session ring drain is header-driven — a leftover 1 MB ring file from a pre-update session can no longer SIGBUS after the capacity bump
- logs(managed): ConsoleService ring 5000 entries / 4 MB → 40000 / 16 MB so Editor/Standalone/Switch reports match the mobile lanes
- perf(ios): memMap itemises CoreAnimation / image-decode / WebKit buckets and names heavy VM tags inside privateOther, so jetsam-ceiling footprints get attribution

## [0.8.167] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- logs: reports attach the ENTIRE session — 16 MB log rings on all lanes (was 1 MB ring windowed to 500 KB start + 500 KB tail, ~one video's worth at typical rates)
- logs: report path streams the ring into gzip in 256 KB chunks (no ring-sized allocations — safe on soft-OOM reports); crash drains gzip their log dumps before upload
- logs(ios): prev-session ring drain is header-driven — a leftover 1 MB ring file from a pre-update session can no longer SIGBUS after the capacity bump
- logs(managed): ConsoleService ring 5000 entries / 4 MB → 40000 / 16 MB so Editor/Standalone/Switch reports match the mobile lanes
- perf(ios): memMap itemises CoreAnimation / image-decode / WebKit buckets and names heavy VM tags inside privateOther, so jetsam-ceiling footprints get attribution

## [0.8.166] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- Add "Request a Feature" entry to the debug pill overflow menu on all lanes (iOS/Android/managed) — opens the standalone feedback board directly, sidestepping the inbox-embedded Feature tab
- Editor Debug Tools: faster load + render — narrow the reflection scan to Bugpunch-referencing assemblies, and patch a single tool row on result instead of re-rendering the whole list

## [0.8.165] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- Fix managed-lane report crash 'get_frameCount can only be called from the main thread': Async.ToMainThread now runs its frame-wait inside the main-thread post (never off-thread), so a report forwarded from a background thread no longer throws inside DelayFrames; DelayFrames also gains a guard that degrades to a single yield if ever entered off the main thread

## [0.8.164] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- Shrink report uploads so video reports stop timing out on slow links: crash/bug-report video window trimmed 90s→45s and bitrate 2.5→2.0 Mbps (≈2.5x smaller, quality preserved at the ≤720 short-edge game-capture clamp), and the log part is now gzipped on upload (~10x smaller logs) across Android, iOS and the managed lane — the server sniffs the gzip magic and inflates

## [0.8.163] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- sdk(ios): stop ANR watchdog OSLogStore scrape crashing the host game during full-screen ads (SIGSEGV inside Apple's OSLog entry decode, seen on iPadOS 26.5 beta)
- sdk(ios): gate render-freeze/GPU-hang classification on UnityIsPaused — a deliberately paused player loop (AdMob full-screen ads, pause menus, profile picker) is an expected freeze, not a hang
- sdk(ios): gpu_hang now requires the hang-class Metal command-buffer error signal; reports carry metal_error name+code (replaces the scraped ioaf_code)

## [0.8.162] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Feature board: admin-curated tags — choose on create, coloured chips, tappable filter chips under the search bar
- Feature board: filter to My Requests; larger row thumbnails; upvote moved to the right in the detail view
- Feature board: show the poster's in-game name on posts and comments
- Feature board: comment count shown on each post
- Create form: title (first line) is kept distinct from the description, plus an optional details note
- Chat: allow sending a photo with no text (updated composer hint)
- Inbox: higher-contrast back button and spacing before the Ask For Help tab
- Android: fix screenshot/recording attach dropping the user back to Ask For Help

## [0.8.161] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Android: fix feedback attach redirecting to 'Ask For Help' — the capture pill's return path now preserves the host Inbox tab, so attaching a screenshot/recording returns to the Request-A-Feature composer instead of resetting to the Ask tab
- New Bugpunch.RequestFeature() C# API — opens the Request-A-Feature board directly (one tap, skips the 3-button help picker); public players are login-gated first, testers go straight in. Native-owned on Android + iOS, managed UIToolkit inbox on Editor + Standalone

## [0.8.160] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Multi-lane stability & performance: crash drain improvements, upload queue resilience, ANR watchdog hardening, performance monitoring enhancements, Remote IDE console service improvements

## [0.8.159] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- iOS: SIGABRT-class crashes (abort/assert/IL2CPP-fatal) now carry a stack_mem blob via a pre-spawned helper thread, so the server CFI unwinder recovers deep stacks the FP walk couldn't
- iOS: survivable crash-report ordering — module table, registers, and stack memory written before ---STACK--- so a truncated report still carries the server-CFI evidence
- iOS: ANR/stall reports capture every thread (---ALL_THREADS---), letting the server relocate the wedged render/GL worker on GPU hangs; main-thread frames still mirrored under ---STACK---
- iOS: evict the highest-address system module slot for a late-loaded app image (dlopen'd ad/analytics/IAP framework) when the module table is full, so its frames symbolicate instead of nearest-matching the wrong image
- iOS: symbol upload subtracts the __TEXT vmaddr so sidecar addresses are image-offset relative — fixes main-executable frames being looked up 4 GB too low and resolving to the wrong symbol
- iOS + Android: frame-pointer unwind rejects a wild/stale fp below the stack pointer, preventing a garbage caller frame that nearest-matched the wrong module
- iOS: GPU capture pool trimmed to 3 buffers (~13 MB lower peak footprint), dropping a frame under encoder stall rather than growing the pool
- iOS + Android: live Remote IDE stream long-edge cap 1080 → 720 to match the recording and cut encode cost

## [0.8.158] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- iOS: background-GPU (Metal NotPermitted) reports now carry the submitting thread's backtrace (bp.gpuSubmitStack) — captured at command-buffer creation while backgrounded, dladdr-formatted for symbolication, to pinpoint the offending game submission

## [0.8.157] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- iOS: background-GPU (Metal NotPermitted) reports now carry the submitting thread's backtrace (bp.gpuSubmitStack) — captured at command-buffer creation while backgrounded, dladdr-formatted for symbolication, to pinpoint the offending game submission

## [0.8.156] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- iOS: background-GPU (Metal NotPermitted) reports now carry the submitting thread's backtrace (bp.gpuSubmitStack) — captured at command-buffer creation while backgrounded, dladdr-formatted for symbolication, to pinpoint the offending game submission

## [0.8.155] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Fix: game-data attachment-rule files silently dropped from native crashes/ANRs (Android + iOS). The crash drain runs in a fresh next-launch process and read attachment rules only from the in-memory config, so any rule registered at RUNTIME via Bugpunch.AddAttachmentRule (which died with the crashed process) was absent — the drain never advertised attach_<name> in phase-1 attachmentsAvailable, so the server never invited the files (server-side ingest was fine). Now: C# pushes the effective rule set to native on AddAttachmentRule (BugpunchNative.PushAttachmentRules); native persists it to disk (BugpunchRuntime.updateAttachmentRules/persistAttachmentRules on Android, Bugpunch_UpdateAttachmentRules on iOS); and the crash drain reads the union of the live config + the persisted snapshot (getDrainAttachmentRules / BPEffectiveAttachmentRules). Persist happens only on rule updates + server merge, never at startup, so a fresh launch never clobbers the crashed session's runtime rules before the drain reads them. Manual reports + live exceptions were unaffected (they run in the live session). Fail-safe: any persistence miss falls back to prior behaviour. Regression traced to the v0.8.124 reporting unification.

## [0.8.154] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Android GPU crash-frame retain (completes the option-A native side; the C# driver shipped inert in v0.8.153). Tester-gated ~4Hz blit of the last composited frame into a persistent CPU-mappable AHardwareBuffer, read to CPU ONLY at crash — no PixelCopy, no continuous readback. GLES (bp_gpu.c): isolated shared EGL context + EGLImage-backed FBO ring, glFinish-published double buffer. Vulkan (bp_gpu_vk.c): CPU-readable AHB ring blitted on Unity's command buffer, HOST_READ barrier, safeFrameNumber-gated publish (FIRST CUT, mirrors the video Vulkan path's on-device-verify status). bp.c crash-shot helper now prefers the retain dump (AHardwareBuffer_lock on the pre-spawned helper thread) and emits frame_format:rgba8888/frame_w/frame_h; falls back to one-shot PixelCopy when no retain frame exists. C# BugpunchCrashRetain pushes 540-capped AHB dims and arms both native lanes. Fail-safe: any retain failure falls back to PixelCopy — never worse than before.

## [0.8.153] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Remove the storyboard feature entirely (per-UI-press frame ring + its crash/context screenshot fallback) from all lanes + the bp.c NDK signal handler — cuts device capture cost, the latent large-iPad full-res risk, and the per-press GPU/PixelCopy work. Context/"moment before" and idle-crash screenshots now come from the recording frame or the at-crash GPU grab only.
- iOS: tester-gated ~4Hz crash-frame retain — the Metal present hook keeps the latest presented frame as a GPU IOSurface (read to CPU only at crash), so a tester's crash/ANR/idle report still carries a screenshot without the storyboard ring. Public players never arm it.
- Android: C# GPU crash-frame retain driver (CaptureScreenshotIntoRenderTexture at 4Hz -> EVENT_RETAIN, tester-gated, skips while recording; no PixelCopy). The native AHardwareBuffer handler (bp_gpu.c GLES + bp_gpu_vk.c Vulkan + signal-handler read) is a follow-up, so the driver is inert until it lands.
- Engine-allocator OOM: live-detect Unity "Could not allocate memory: System out of memory!" on all lanes, parse the [ALLOC_*] Memory overview into a fresh memMap, classify it distinct from a jetsam kill, and stand down the next-launch OOM heuristic so the same death isn't double-filed.
- iOS Metal NotPermitted: tag app foreground/background state on the error line, fingerprint background GPU submissions apart from real in-frame command-buffer faults (background_gpu_work), and refuse the SDK's own one-shot capture while backgrounded.
- SDK UI nav breadcrumbs: write [Bugpunch][UI] open/close/push/pop into the captured log ring on all three lanes so a "froze when I opened chat" report shows which SDK surface was up.
- iOS capture: drop the one-shot GPU grab when the MPS scaler is unavailable instead of silently storing a full-resolution frame (a large-iPad memory floor).

## [0.8.152] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- iOS: remove every UIKit drawViewHierarchyInRect capture path (report/exception shots, storyboard press frames, dead ANR precapture) — hierarchy draws force-decode third-party ad UIImageViews via ImageIO/vImage and SIGSEGV the host game; GPU one-shot is now the only live capture, falling back to the newest storyboard ring frame, with an async watchdog so callers always hear back when no present arrives
- iOS: Metal present-hook swizzle is now retryable — lazy re-init from CaptureOneShot/StartGpuCapture (the concrete CAMetalDrawable class can be realized after SDK boot) plus a guard so a re-init can never capture our own swizzled IMP as the original

## [0.8.151] - 2026-07-02

## [0.8.150] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- Tester crash review actually engages (both lanes): the hold + stepper now key on a locally SAVED internal/external profile (hasValidTesterProfile) as well as the cached role - the role event rides the tunnel and lands AFTER the boot drain, so the cached role alone raced to "public" and internal testers got silent uploads with no review popup. iOS stepper present now retries until a UIWindow exists (tier-1 kicked it pre-window and gave up) plus a tier-2 Unity-time re-kick; held manifests auto-release after 24h unreviewed on both lanes so review can never delay a crash forever - delivery is never gated on review.

## [0.8.149] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- iOS: Mach exception handler is now deadlock-proof (sdk#76) - the report path uses the same async-signal-safe fd writers as the signal handler (no NSLog/NSString/malloc/log-reader lock while the faulting thread is suspended), the at-crash screenshot rides the bounded helper-thread capture, and handler breadcrumbs go to stderr via write(2) so they still reach the log session. Field failure: EXC_BAD_ACCESS logged one line then wedged - no report, no next-launch review popup, nothing server-side.

## [0.8.148] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- Efficiency pass + video-ring hardening + native audio path (all lanes)
- - Thermal governor now actually throttles the recorder on both lanes: iOS governor fps reaches capture pacing (Bugpunch_SetGpuCapturePace); Android governor gains its first listener - live AMediaCodec bitrate retarget + OnGpuCapturePace to the C# pacer; thermal seed read synchronously
- - pauseRing now pauses VIDEO natively (bp_video.c pause flag + C# blit stop via OnGpuCapturePause); iOS gains full UI-pause parity (report/chat/feedback/inbox/annotate/tools no longer overwrite pre-incident footage)
- - Ring "latest footage" invariant hardened: Android codec-death/init/EGL-loss failures now disarm + surface videoStatus (init_error/encoder_error); iOS bounds session-recreate retries + fails start on ring-init failure; disk-full SIGBUS fixed on both lanes (posix_fallocate/F_PREALLOCATE with halving retry - recording survives a full disk with a smaller window); Android teardown use-after-munmap race closed
- - Fully-native recording audio (sdk#79): C# tap pushes PCM via one P/Invoke from the audio DSP thread on BOTH lanes; Android encodes AAC in bp_audio.c (NDK) into the crash ring - Java audio chain deleted; iOS ring-audio capture path implemented (AAC into v2 audio sub-stream; remux track pending sdk#69)
- - Audio tap now exists only while recording (was always-on for every user incl. Public)
- - Perf events: role-aware cadence (testers 60s / Public 300s), batched array POST, client timestamp field; iOS watermark/memMap park writes mirrored to Android's delta-skip throttle
- - iOS: capture pool bounded under encoder backpressure + MaxFrameDelayCount + MaximizePowerEfficiency; sidecar touch export drops the 2MB JSON parse round-trip; per-log-line tunnel encode gated
- - Android: device-side mp4 faststart pass removed (server faststarts at ingest, sdk#78); GOP 2s + best-effort codec priority; /proc + binder polling slowed; uploader manifest-scan cache; analytics buffer O(1) eviction
- - C#/IDE: screenshots via AsyncGPUReadback + worker-thread JPEG; WebRTC stats-report leak fixed; WebRTC.Update pump + desktop capture stop with the last viewer; chat poll incremental (?since=) with adaptive cadence; ConsoleService byte budget; RoleState TTL cache

## [0.8.147] - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- iOS report/exception screenshots now capture GPU-first (Unity's rendered frame straight off the Metal drawable) instead of drawViewHierarchyInRect - fixes an EXC_BAD_ACCESS that could crash the host game during capture (e.g. inside an ad view's ImageIO decode); JPEG encode moved off the main and render threads; screenshots capped at 720px long side on iOS and Android
- Tester crash-review: on the launch after a crash, internal/external testers review each pending crash (screenshot + details) and can add steps-to-reproduce before it uploads; public players still upload silently (iOS + Android)

## [0.8.146] - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- iOS report/exception screenshots now capture GPU-first (Unity's rendered frame straight off the Metal drawable) instead of drawViewHierarchyInRect - fixes an EXC_BAD_ACCESS that could crash the host game during capture (e.g. inside an ad view's ImageIO decode); JPEG encode moved off the main and render threads; screenshots capped at 720px long side on iOS and Android

## [0.8.145] - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- Log session is per-launch: stop rotating it on focus-blur / background-resume so a run stays ONE continuous log session. Fixes clients whose logs split across a root + tiny resume children and went missing in the merged / linked-session viewer (which resolves a client to a single session file). C# ConsoleService mints once at load; Android logs/crashes/reports stamp the launch-stable root while sSessionId keeps rotating for ANALYTICS only; iOS BugpunchTunnel gSessionId no longer rotates (analytics gAnalyticsSessionId still does). Analytics session boundaries unchanged.

## [0.8.144] - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- Add Bugpunch.SessionId — a per-run session id (fresh each app launch / Play Mode entry, available at RuntimeInitializeOnLoad) stamped on every report and the linked-session registration. The run identity that lets the server tell one match from the stale one that reused the same linked-session key (managed lane; device lanes already carry session_root_id).

## [0.8.143] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- DeviceIdentity: distinct deviceId for two local instances on one PC (ParrelSync host+joiner multiplayer testing). ParrelSync junctions Assets so Application.dataPath resolves to the same path for the original + clone, collapsing both into one client. Editor now keys the id off the launch -projectPath (the real, un-junctioned clone root, e.g. UnityProj_MTD_clone_0); standalone salts deviceUniqueIdentifier with the install folder so two local builds in different folders stay distinct too. Managed lane only.

Managed lane only.

## [0.8.141] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Editor: register linked sessions in the Unity Editor (managed lane). RegisterLinkedSession no longer early-outs on Application.isEditor, so in-Editor / ParrelSync / Standalone multiplayer playtests group into one linked session (the common case for local MP testing). Mirrors: managed lane only — native Android/iOS analytics already upload on device.

## [0.8.140] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Register linked sessions on the managed lane (Editor+Standalone)
- - The managed lane has no native analytics uploader, so JoinLinkedSession's
-   linked_session.join event was a no-op there — desktop/standalone clients never
-   registered a linked session at join. Now POST it to /api/v1/analytics/events
-   directly (reusing the managed reporter's apiKey/baseUrl) so they do.

## [0.8.139] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Register linked sessions on join + finish multiplayer→linked rename
- - JoinLinkedSession now fires a linked_session.join analytics event, so the server
-   registers the linked session the moment clients join a lobby — it shows during
-   play without waiting for a crash/report
- - Rename every remaining 'multiplayer' identifier to 'linked session' across all
-   lanes (wire field linkedSessionId, native setLinkedSession/runtime fields, etc.)

## [0.8.138] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Rename multiplayer-session API to linked-session (not multiplayer-specific)
- - Bugpunch.JoinLinkedSession / SetLinkedSessionTag / LeaveLinkedSession replace the
-   JoinMultiplayerSession trio (clean rename, no obsolete aliases). Same cross-client
-   log/issue correlation — now named for any shared session (co-op, party, world, match)

## [0.8.137] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Multiplayer session correlation — tie every client in a match into one joint session
- - New public API: Bugpunch.JoinMultiplayerSession(matchId, info) / SetMultiplayerTag / LeaveMultiplayerSession
- - Game-supplied match id + per-client tags (role=host, team, name) stamped on every report/crash on all lanes (C#, Android, iOS) and on the next-launch crash drain
- - Server correlates occurrences/logs by match id; new Multiplayer Sessions dashboard with a merged, clock-aligned joint log, in-log issue markers, and a one-click Share-to-AI brief

## [0.8.136] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Multiplayer session correlation — tie every client in a match into one joint session
- - New public API: Bugpunch.JoinMultiplayerSession(matchId, info) / SetMultiplayerTag / LeaveMultiplayerSession
- - Game-supplied match id + per-client tags (role=host, team, name) stamped on every report/crash on all lanes (C#, Android, iOS) and on the next-launch crash drain

## [0.8.135] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Scripting IDE: pluggable workspace persistence via IWorkspaceStore (FileWorkspaceStore default + DelegateWorkspaceStore) so each game saves/loads scripts + data its own way; per-level scoping via a level-scoped store; Workspace.Reload() for live level swap; IdeOptions.Store honored by ScriptIde.Host
- Scripting IDE: restyled to Visual Studio - menu bar (File/Edit/View/Project/Build/Help), Solution Explorer on the right + Properties panel, Error List/Output/Console docked tabs with a clickable diagnostics grid, VS dark theme with the purple status bar
- Scripting: cleaned leftover "mod" naming (LevelMods -> Level Scripts, ModUIPanel -> ScriptUIPanel, __Mod__ -> __Script__, stale ModData/ModUI doc refs)

## [0.8.134] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- fix(android): route exception/report forward through raw JNI so it bypasses Unity's reflection method-id cache (com.unity3d.player.Q), which NPE'd on cold reportBug resolution mid-teardown — ate a real game exception and filed an [SDK] hashCode self-error in its place (issue eaac28d1). Pre-warm the report-path JNI handles on the main thread in Start so an off-thread / mid-storm forward never resolves cold.

## [0.8.133] - 2026-06-30

Pre-warm the report-path JNI handles on the main thread in Start so an off-thread / mid-storm forward never resolves cold.

## [0.8.132] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- Null-pointer-call crashes (pc=lr=fp=0, empty frame walk) now recover their caller chain. The Android signal handler captures the fault-time stack snapshot via a fault-safe pipe fallback when the OS denies /proc/self/mem (observed on hardened ROMs, e.g. an Android 15 build on the Nexus 5X), so the server's stack-scan unwinder always has fuel; the server now also adopts those scan frames when the on-device walk found nothing, and the empty-stack note distinguishes a null PC from a truncated report.
- Crash-survivable memMap is now parked on scene change, so a later crash carries the Memory tab even with no debugger attached and no prior memory pressure (Android + iOS + C#).

## [0.8.131] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- perf(scripting): pool VM instances + reuse locals frame — per-frame Update() drops from ~8KB to ~200 bytes/call
- perf(scripting): route iterator MoveNext, async builder, operator fallbacks and lambdas through the VM pool (no new VM() per call)
- perf(scripting): cache ParameterInfo[] per method — kills the per-host-call array clone
- refactor(scripting): rename modding API to ScriptBehaviour* (ScriptMod->ScriptBehaviour, ModHost->ScriptBehaviourHost, ModManager->ScriptBehaviourManager, IModObjectHost->IScriptObjectHost); synthetic wrapper class Mod->Script
- scripting engine: async lowering, emitter, parser and ScriptHost fast-path invoker work

## [0.8.130] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Scripting Web IDE: full-fledged flex UI editor with live USS cascade
- - Visual designer rebuilt on real flex/UXML parenting (drag-to-reorder/reparent, insertion caret) instead of absolute positioning
- - USS now cascades end-to-end: live in the designer preview and applied at runtime (type/class/#name/descendant/child selectors, USS specificity, inline-wins)
- - Pseudo-state support with a canvas preview toggle (hover/active/focus/checked/disabled); added text-shadow / transform / transition translation
- - New pure-BCL UssCascade engine in the bundled ODDGames.Scripting DLL; class-chip + matched-rule style editing in the property panel

## [0.8.129] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Scripting Web IDE: full-fledged flex UI editor with live USS cascade

## [0.8.128] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- iOS symbol upload: ship the llvm-nm .symtab sidecar (~15MB) instead of the full dSYM (~1GB). The Xcode build hook now runs the toolchain's llvm-nm locally and POSTs only the symbol table to the new /api/symbols/sidecar/upload endpoint, cutting symbol-upload bandwidth and server-side storage ~98%. The uploaded bytes are identical to the sidecar the server used to extract from the dSYM, so symbolication is unchanged. Requires server with the sidecar endpoint (shipped separately).

## [0.8.127] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Fix iOS/Android crash symbolication: native crash handlers now capture app-bundle images (UnityFramework, libil2cpp, the main binary) before shared-cache system libraries in a two-pass module-table snapshot. dyld/load order could place UnityFramework after 1000+ system libs, so a >MAX_MODULES image count truncated it out of the report — game-code crash frames then mis-resolved to the nearest third-party framework (e.g. FBSDKCoreKit) and never symbolicated. App images are now always kept; only un-symbolicatable system images are ever dropped.

## [0.8.126] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Upload retries no longer hammer a slow server: the native upload queue caps a manifest at 2 attempts per app SESSION and defers the rest to a future launch, instead of re-POSTing the full payload on every drain (drain fires on every enqueue). Durability is unchanged — the persisted 10-attempt / 48h budget still governs permanent drop ACROSS sessions. Fixes one user report arriving as several duplicates when an overloaded server ingested it but didn't ack before the 60s client timeout. Android + iOS.
- Reports carry the Memory tab: every live report — including manual user reports, not just crashes/OOM — now attaches the memory snapshot (native per-region PSS + OS-kill headroom plus the engine asset sweep), so the dashboard Memory tab renders for user reports; a fresh engine asset sweep is requested when the report form opens. Android + iOS.
- Inbox triage state: player inbox items now show when each issue was raised and whether the team has reviewed it yet ("Seen by team" / "Awaiting review"). Android + iOS + Editor/Standalone.

## [0.8.125] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Crash/report uploads survive cache eviction: the native upload queue now recreates its cache dir and retries once when a manifest write fails under storage pressure (cache evicted / disk full) instead of dropping the report — and no longer self-reports the storage failure as a per-project exception (the random manifest name defeated error dedup and the report's own upload re-entered the same failing path). Android + iOS.

## [0.8.124] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Unify issue reporting so crashes, native crashes, ANRs, OOM kills, exceptions and user reports all collect the same data set.
- - Shared device/app env builder across the live report path and the next-launch crash drain (Android appendEnvBlocks, iOS BPAppendEnvBlocks) so a native crash/ANR/OOM carries byte-identical device/app metadata to a live exception.
- - Game SetTag context recovered on hard crashes: tags parked into the crash-survivable perf sidecar and merged by the drain (Android + iOS); managed lane (Standalone/Switch) gains a SetTag store so its reports carry game tags too.
- - Managed reporter aligned to the native field set: nested device + reporter blocks, scene-in-app.
- - Storyboard screenshots gated to Mid+High memory tiers (low-tier devices collect everything else) and cleared on memory pressure to avoid contributing to an OOM; parked OOM evidence shot + memsnapshot + perf ramp preserved.
- - OOM memory evidence: native signal handler stamps the parked memsnapshot path + a death-moment RSS footprint (async-signal-safe); managed lane parks a pressure-time memory snapshot for later OOM reports.

## [0.8.123] - 2026-06-26

### Changed
- iOS OOM detection rebuilt to the industry-standard exclusion method (Facebook/Sentry watchdog-termination tracker) plus MetricKit MXAppExitMetric — replaces the >100MB unclean-exit heuristic that over-fired; a previous session is attributed a foreground OOM only after ruling out app upgrade, OS upgrade, device reboot, a real crash, normal termination, and background/force-quit kills
- iOS: crashedLastRun crash sentinel (written async-signal-safely by the signal + Mach doors) so a real crash is never mis-counted as an OOM
- iOS: link MetricKit.framework for the OS-authoritative memory-resource-limit exit counts
- C#: BugpunchOomWatch promotes the engine soft-OOM allocator log to a grouped exception Issue on the managed lane (Standalone/Switch), where no OS exit-reason API exists
- C#: centralize the bp.memMap fold at the single ReportBug choke; drop redundant per-callsite double-adds in BugpunchCrashHandler

## [0.8.122] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- Comment on a recent report instead of filing a duplicate: when an internal tester sends a bug report within 30s of a previous one, a chooser now lists the recent reports — each with a looping last-10s video preview (Android/iOS) or storyboard-frame screenshot (managed lane, which has no video ring) plus its description — so they can add a comment, carrying this fresh screenshot/video as a new occurrence, instead of raising a duplicate issue. New BugpunchRecentReports store + BugpunchReportChooser on all three lanes; reuses the existing issue-detail comment surface (pre-staged with the fresh capture) and the /api/v1/issues comment + comment-attachments endpoints. The uploader now parses the ingest issueId so the chooser can target the grouped issue.
- Bundled: in-progress Goal HUD / banner, chat, and report-tunnel refinements.

## [0.8.121] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- Remote IDE: non-internal devices (External/Public) in debug mode are now connectable — the tester approves the connection on-device (once per app run, persists across reconnects) and can revoke it via a "being debugged — tap to disconnect" chip; only Internal devices auto-connect. Fixes the 403 "Device not enrolled for remote debugging" that blocked every interactive IDE call (scenes, hierarchy, video, and live Run-a-script) on non-internal devices. All three lanes (C#, Android, iOS) plus server + dashboard.
- Editor: the generated Bugpunch Resources artifacts (goal catalog, asset index, property drawers, tag list, inspector schema) are no longer written into the consumer project's tracked Assets/ tree on every Play — a build-time coordinator injects them in-memory for the editor and bakes them as real assets only at player build, removing the version-control noise.

## [0.8.119] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Upload status pill (Android + iOS) now gates on a saved, valid tester profile instead of the sticky cached tester role. The keychain role state (role_state_v1) survives logout and reinstall, so at startup the native crash-drain would flash "Sending crash report…" off a stale role with nobody signed in. BugpunchUploader.publishStatus + the BugpunchRuntime upload observer (Android) and BPShouldShowBanner (iOS) now key off hasValidTesterProfile / Bugpunch_HasValidTesterProfile; public players and signed-out devices stay silent. Also skips the listFiles() queue walk for signed-out devices, not just public-role ones.

## [0.8.118] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Goal HUD: show the FULL pending-goal list — the build-time catalog scanner now captures fluent assertion goals (Bugpunch.Goal("x").IsTrue/.Is/.IsNot/.IsFalse), not just the observe/evaluator forms, so the on-device HUD lists every declared goal instead of collapsing to "1/1"
- Goal HUD: editor (managed lane) re-bakes + force-reimports the goal catalog on entering play, so the in-editor HUD always has the complete list — a batch device-build writing the catalog from another Unity process no longer leaves the interactive editor's copy stale (empty catalog → 1/1)
- Goal HUD: skip now advances to the next still-pending goal (wraps) instead of snapping back to the top
- Goal HUD: internal/external testers receive a server-pushed goal list merged over the baked catalog (by id), so a tester on an older build still sees the current project goals

## [0.8.117] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- New fluent assertion Goal API (all lanes): Bugpunch.Goal("text").IsTrue(actual, whenMissed) / .IsFalse(...) / .Is(actual, expected, whenMissed) / .IsNot(actual, expected, whenMissed), with an optional .Priority()/.Instructions()/.Category() chain. The terminal fires UNCONDITIONALLY at the call site (no if-guard) carrying actual + expected; the SDK decides hit vs miss by equality (inverted for IsNot/IsFalse). Hit → server goal.observed + a confetti celebrate on the QA HUD; miss → the HUD shakes with the required whenMissed reason + a local QA log line (no server miss event). Deduped per call site by the actual value so an unguarded per-frame assertion is cheap
- Replaces the old observe-on-reach Bugpunch.Goal(text, value) overload — reaching the line no longer IS the observation; you now state actual + expected and the SDK judges it
- Goal HUD / top-banner redesign across all lanes (C# BugpunchGoalHud + BugpunchGoalBannerManaged, Android BugpunchGoalBanner, iOS BugpunchTopBanner): celebrate on hit, shake + reason toast on miss, expected-value hint, priority/category ordering
- DebugToolsBridge: goal debug surface for the in-app tools menu
- Goal signal stays QA-only — public players accrue no goal progress (assertion emit gated)

## [0.8.116] - 2026-06-24

- Goal signal stays QA-only — public players accrue no goal progress (assertion emit gated)

## [0.8.115] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Fix PlayerPrefs enumeration in the Remote IDE — it returned nothing on Windows/macOS (Editor + Standalone) and on iOS. The runtime DLL's frozen #defines silently compiled out every desktop path; switched to runtime Application.platform dispatch. Windows now reads the registry via RegistryKey.OpenBaseKey (Unity Mono returns null for Registry.CurrentUser) and strips the correct decimal _h<hash> suffix.
- PlayerPrefs on Android + iOS now enumerate natively from the canonical store — SharedPreferences.getAll() (BugpunchPlayerPrefs.java) and NSUserDefaults persistentDomainForName (BugpunchPlayerPrefs.mm) — instead of fragile XML parsing (Android) or nothing at all (iOS).
- Add texture reference lookup to the Remote IDE Textures panel (/textures/references) with asset-index export support.
- Siaqodb database plugin improvements.

- Siaqodb database plugin improvements.

## [0.8.113] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Bug bounty named reward-type presets (client side, all 3 lanes): the claim popup now shows the reward type's hero image + type name, and OnBountyEarned forwards typeId/typeName/imageUrl/requireWebhook. requireWebhook=true means the server already granted via webhook (popup is informational); false means the game grants the reward itself in OnBountyEarned (dedupe on bountyId) — pairs with the server reward-types feature
- Goal progress no longer accrues for public players: GoalReporter gates observe / evaluator / step / watch at the emit choke points and skips the evaluator poll, so the broad cohort emits no goal.observed and doesn't drive the server-side public goal pass. Re-checked each tick so a mid-session role change to tester resumes (C# only — game-side evaluators have no native lane)
- Role-aware analytics flush cadence (Android + iOS): testers flush tight (15s) so QA sees dashboard reactions fast; public players flush on a 90s window to cut battery/radio/server load. Window read fresh each arm so a role change takes effect mid-session; size threshold + flush-on-background still bound latency/loss
- iOS build: register Sign in with Apple as a target capability (ProjectCapabilityManager.AddSignInWithApple) in addition to the entitlements-file key, plus a build-time verify — fixes the entitlement being stripped from the signed binary under automatic signing against a stale profile (MTD ASAuthorizationError 1000)

## [0.8.112] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- broken_shader / gpu_hang reports now ride the standard full-data report path (screenshot, logs, perf timeline, touches, storyboard), server-budget-gated per fingerprint like crashes — no more bespoke metadata-only POST or material-swatch enrich; grouping fingerprint unchanged (matched line + graphicsDeviceType), shader name/class ride extraJson tags
- Reports with no video still snapshot the 30 s perf/touch window leading up to them, so the data set no longer diverges by debug mode (only the MP4 is debug-gated)
- iOS/Android: context "moment-before" screenshot now sourced from the always-on storyboard ring when not recording (mirrors existing Android behaviour)
- Remote IDE: memory snapshot can render a downscaled PNG texture preview (GET /memory/preview?id=&max=) so QA can see a texture's contents; aspect-preserved, capped at maxDim, unsupported for cubemap/3D/array

## [0.8.111] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

## [0.8.110] - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- Goal HUD now surfaces one-shot observe goals. Previously the on-device 'next goal' toast only showed evaluator/step goals; a game built from inline Bugpunch.Goal(text, value) observe goals (the common pattern) gave the HUD nothing and it stayed blank. The declared-goal catalog is now baked into the build (Resources TextAsset) so the HUD shows the next not-yet-hit goal of any form, fully local. C#-only fix — all lanes (selection is C# on every lane; native renderers unchanged). Internal: iOS post-build hook moved out of Recorder/ and converted to IPostprocessBuildWithReport.

## [0.8.109] - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- Crash reports now carry the Bugpunch SDK version. Native-drained crashes (OOM kill, native signal, ANR, GPU hang) and the C# managed-lane reporter were uploading no app-identity block, so the Issue Environment tab showed a blank SDK version. All lanes (Android drain, iOS drain, C# managed reporter) now attach sdkVersion/unityVersion/bundleId; the server also falls back to the device's last-registered sdk_version when a sample lacks the tag.

## [0.8.108] - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- sdk(ios): Sign in with Apple entitlement reliably lands in the signed binary — re-assert CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS across all build configs and log the final entitlement keys, so a project stacked with competing iOS post-build hooks (GooglePlayGames/Firebase) can't leave the Release signature pointed at a file/config without com.apple.developer.applesignin (the cause of instant ASAuthorizationError 1000 / 'Continue with Apple' failing before any UI).

## [0.8.107] - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- Missing video/screenshot now surface as structured videoStatus/screenshotStatus the dashboard renders in place of the media, instead of uploading a *_unavailable.txt stub (Android + iOS)
- Editor mapping.txt upload switched to presigned PUT-to-S3 (presign -> PUT -> record), avoiding a 50 MB round-trip through the API

## [0.8.106] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- role-gated BugpunchLog on all 3 lanes: Bugpunch's own console/logcat output is silent for Public users (incl. errors); only Internal + External testers see [Bugpunch.*]. Central BugpunchLog wrapper (C# RoleState gate, Android Log.x->BugpunchLog, iOS NSLog->BPLOG); now a THREE_LANE_MIRRORS entry.

## [0.8.105] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- OOM / LOW_MEMORY kill diagnostics: poll headroom on every perf tick and, on an imminent kill (a recent CRITICAL/COMPLETE memory trim, or system headroom collapsing toward the LMK/jetsam threshold), keep the perf ramp warm and refresh an on-disk light memory snapshot on the fast cadence — so the uncatchable kill still ships a fresh "where did the memory go" breakdown. The AEI/crash synth now attaches that parked perf ramp + memory snapshot + the dead session's last-known scene to the OOM/LOW_MEMORY issue (fixes "No scene" grouping). C# folds in an engine asset-memory sweep (BugpunchMemoryMap — engine totals + per-category textures/meshes/materials/audio + heaviest assets) via a throttled native memory-pressure ping. Android + iOS + C#.
- Method profiler: a woven build whose sites all stay under the 1 s capture floor (a light scene) now still emits its busiest few method rows, so an idle clip is no longer mistaken for an uninstrumented build — the Issue-detail Methods tab was wrongly reading "no method profiler" on quiet recordings. C#/managed lane; native just relays the row.
- Credential sign-in: full-screen translucent sheet with its own dim backdrop so the profile picker no longer bleeds through the card edges, and a keyboard-inset ScrollView keeps Continue/Cancel reachable in landscape (was cut off above the soft keyboard). Android + iOS.
- Quieter SDK-error reporting: transient transport conditions on the tunnel / poller — SocketException (incl. Conscrypt "Socket is closed") and nv-websocket protocol codes (server closed mid-handshake on a deploy / load-balancer cycle, peer EOF, socket read/write/connect failures) — no longer surface as SDK exceptions; they self-heal via reconnect and are already recorded in the tunnelDiagnostics frame. Genuine cert / proxy / hostname-verification errors still surface. Android.
- App lifecycle: resumed-count-based active state for the render-freeze / GPU-hang gate, matching iOS BPAppLifecycle.isActive — an ad / IAP sheet / permission dialog / incoming call now correctly flips the app inactive. Android + iOS.

## [0.8.104] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- Stop per-frame/per-event log spam during touch input & streaming (flooded the shipped log and allocated GC each frame on drags)
- C#: skip the per-move /input/pointer log; demote pointer-lifecycle (down/move/up/cancel) and per-ICE-candidate WebRTC signal logs to Debug
- Android: remove per-RPC sendResponse and per-event sendEvent trace logs in BugpunchTunnel (logcat capture ships all levels, so these had to go, not just demote)
- iOS: remove the per-poll [BP-DIAG] chat-state log in BugpunchPoller
- Internal: workspace-wide comment cleanup across all lanes — drop change-history narration and obvious restatement comments

## [0.8.102] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Fix dark Android video on the Vulkan capture path (bp_gpu_vk.c): the RT(sRGB)->AHB(R8G8B8A8_UNORM) vkCmdBlitImage decodes sRGB->linear and stores the darker linear values, which were then H.264-encoded raw. Re-encode linear->sRGB in the GL encoder-sink fragment shader (where the AHB is sampled into the MediaCodec input surface) so the stream is display-referred; the blit's linear-space scaling is retained. Android Vulkan path only — the GL ES path already passes through via GL_SKIP_DECODE_EXT, and iOS sRGB darkness was already handled.

## [0.8.101] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Fix dark Android video on the Vulkan capture path (bp_gpu_vk.c): the RT(sRGB)->AHB(R8G8B8A8_UNORM) vkCmdBlitImage decodes sRGB->linear and stores the darker linear values, which were then H.264-encoded raw. Re-encode linear->sRGB in the GL encoder-sink fragment shader (where the AHB is sampled into the MediaCodec input surface) so the stream is display-referred; the blit's linear-space scaling is retained. Android Vulkan path only — the GL ES path already passes through via GL_SKIP_DECODE_EXT, and iOS sRGB darkness was already handled.

## [0.8.100] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Benchmark performance samples: native Android + iOS capture of server-requested 90s perf timelines at a uniform anchor (new BugpunchBenchmarkSampler on both lanes), armed via the gameConfig.perfSample anchor (scene / custom-data / stable-for) and a perfSample bootstrap token, uploaded as trigger='benchmark' perf events carrying a videoMeta timeline + screenshot.
- Android perf memory now reports true process RSS (/proc/self/statm) instead of Dalvik/ART heap only — fixes Peak MB reading ~10x low vs iOS on IL2CPP Unity games.
- Bundles other in-flight SDK source edits in the working tree.

## [0.8.99] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Benchmark performance samples: native Android + iOS capture of server-requested 90s perf timelines at a uniform anchor (new BugpunchBenchmarkSampler on both lanes), armed via the gameConfig.perfSample anchor (scene / custom-data / stable-for) and a perfSample bootstrap token, uploaded as trigger='benchmark' perf events carrying a videoMeta timeline + screenshot.
- Android perf memory now reports true process RSS (/proc/self/statm) instead of Dalvik/ART heap only — fixes Peak MB reading ~10x low vs iOS on IL2CPP Unity games.
- Bundles other in-flight SDK source edits in the working tree.

## [0.8.98] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- GPU-only video capture: drop the captureMode choice, ReplayKit (iOS), and MediaProjection (Android)
- - Video + audio recording is now permission-free GPU capture on every lane: no screen-record consent dialog, no persistent notification, no foreground service, no RECORD_AUDIO. Audio is the push-PCM AudioListener tap.
- - Removed BugpunchConfig.captureMode (GPU is the only mode); no longer emitted in the native config blob.
- - iOS: stripped ReplayKit from the crash-ring recorder (dead encode path + retired frame-sink/streaming-capture API); GPU capture is the sole source.
- - Android: removed MediaProjection entirely - deleted BugpunchProjectionRequest/Service, ScreenPipeline, the retired native WebRTC streamer (+ WebrtcAudioInjector / SharedScreenCapturer), and the AudioPlaybackCapture path; rewrote BugpunchRecorder GPU-only; dropped the FOREGROUND_SERVICE / FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION / RECORD_AUDIO manifest permissions and the libwebrtc dep.
- - Chat/feedback video-attach dumps the GPU ring in debug mode; outside debug mode it falls back to a screenshot (fresh on-demand OS-capture clips retired).

## [0.8.97] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- Re-bundle ODDGames.Scripting.dll (reverts the v0.8.96 source-package split)
- Unity does not support Git dependencies in a package's package.json — only in a
- project's manifest.json (per Unity's UPM Git docs). A dependency every Bugpunch
- consumer needs therefore cannot be auto-pulled by the package; it must ship as a
- bundled DLL. v0.8.96 dropped the DLL and required each project to list the
- scripting git repo, which broke consumers. This restores the bundled
- Plugins/ODDGames.Scripting.dll (built from the oddgames/unity-scripting repo by
- build-all). Consumers need zero config again — no manifest entry, no repo auth.

## [0.8.96] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- ODDGames.Scripting split into its own UPM package — consumers must add it to manifest.json
- - The scripting VM (ODDGames.Scripting) is no longer bundled as a DLL inside the
-   Bugpunch package. It now ships as a separate source UPM package and MUST be
-   declared in each Unity project's Packages/manifest.json:
-     "au.com.oddgames.scripting": "https://github.com/oddgames/unity-scripting.git"
- - Removed Plugins/ODDGames.Scripting.dll from the package (it would otherwise
-   collide with the source package's own ODDGames.Scripting assembly).
- - The Bugpunch runtime still references the VM by assembly name; Unity compiles
-   it from the source package.

## [0.8.95] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- sdk: Request Help is now the single public entry; iOS flow + brand-colour fixes. (1) Removed the public Bugpunch.EnterDebugMode() API — debug recording is reached through RequestHelp (internal/external auto-enter) or the help card's 'Record A Bug' (public); the internal native entry is unchanged. (2) iOS: Request Help and Record-A-Bug now fast-path straight to the action when a profile is already selected this session, instead of re-showing the profile picker — routed through the session-gated auto-prompt; EnterDebugMode honours an already-signed-in identity. (3) Primary action buttons are the Bugpunch brand orange instead of green — consent 'Start Recording' + exit-debug buttons explicitly, and the default accentPrimary theme colour on both iOS and Android.

## [0.8.94] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- sdk(ios): deterministic Request Help / profile-pick flow + first-name hint. (1) BPPickerHasPersistedIdentity now reads the in-memory BPRuntime identity instead of re-reading the keychain every call, so the auto-prompt gate no longer flaps — tapping a help-card option resumes the requested action (debug for internal/external, 3-panel for public) instead of bouncing back to the profile picker. (2) The saved-profile tap validates /profiles/select with the picker still up (controls disabled) and dismisses-then-applies only on success, mirroring the SSO tap; removed the optimistic-dismiss race + didOptimisticDismiss reopen machinery. (3) Apple Sign In forwards the first-auth full name to the server as a display-only hint so users show a real name instead of a random relay local-part.

## [0.8.93] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- sdk(ios): clean up the Sign in with Apple / Request Help flow. (1) Provider badges were all blank — the picker loaded badge PNGs via pathForResource only, which misses the bundled assets at runtime; now imageNamed-first (matching the working help-card loader) with an Apple-logo-glyph fallback since no apple-logo.png ships. (2) The 3-panel help card never appeared after a FRESH sign-in: the SSO handlers applied the identity (firing the post-auth callback) while the picker was still mid-dismiss, so UIKit dropped the present — routed all three SSO handlers through a new dismissThenApplyIdentity: that dismisses first and applies in the completion, mirroring the saved-profile tap.

## [0.8.92] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix Sign in with Apple login loop — keychain reads/deletes no longer carry kSecAttrAccessible (a create-only attribute, not a valid match key), so a freshly persisted identity reads back and the picker stops re-prompting after every help-card action; accessibility is now applied only on add. Adds native auth-gate diagnostics (applyIdentity emailReadback + AutoPrompt gate decision) to the device log.

## [0.8.91] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios,csharp): stamp the SDK version on the profile/login picker UIs — subtle but always-legible 'v<version>' watermark on every lane (iOS native picker, Android native picker, C# UIToolkit picker) so anyone can confirm at a glance which SDK build a player/tester is running

## [0.8.90] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- Harden Sign in with Apple across iOS + Android lanes
- Apple Sign In: add per-flow nonce (sha256 to Apple, raw to server) to prevent id-token replay; server verifies the token's nonce claim (iOS native + Android web flow)
- iOS: retain ASAuthorizationController for flow lifetime (fixes "UI provider deallocated" failure); thread-safe delegate set + in-flight guard against concurrent flows
- iOS: prune revoked Apple credentials on picker open; restore lost auth-success callback after a failed /profiles/select reopen
- iOS: keychain items now WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly (no iCloud sync of session tokens); atomic picker-showing guard; treat error 1005 as silent cancel
- iOS: drop non-compliant Apple-button shadow; safer presentation-anchor fallback; entitlement-missing log hint

## [0.8.89] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- Harden Sign in with Apple across iOS + Android lanes
- Apple Sign In: add per-flow nonce (sha256 to Apple, raw to server) to prevent id-token replay; server verifies the token's nonce claim (iOS native + Android web flow)
- iOS: retain ASAuthorizationController for flow lifetime (fixes "UI provider deallocated" failure); thread-safe delegate set + in-flight guard against concurrent flows
- iOS: prune revoked Apple credentials on picker open; restore lost auth-success callback after a failed /profiles/select reopen
- iOS: keychain items now WhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly (no iCloud sync of session tokens); atomic picker-showing guard; treat error 1005 as silent cancel
- iOS: drop non-compliant Apple-button shadow; safer presentation-anchor fallback; entitlement-missing log hint

## [0.8.88] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- sdk(scripting): rebuild the bundled ODDGames.Scripting.dll with the embedded web IDE upgrades -- a host-declared global-event catalog (IdeOptions.EventCatalog / EventCatalogJson + GET /api/events), a live console (ScriptIdeServer.Log -> /api/logs ring) that surfaces game errors in the browser, a Visual-Basic-style UXML designer (drag-drop device canvas, visual anchor presets, USS-to-CSS preview, right-click group/ungroup/z-order, double-click to generate a coupled controller event handler), and a typed visual USS editor covering the Unity USS property reference (color pickers, ranged numbers, length+unit, enum dropdowns).
- sdk(android,ios): sign-in failures now raise a branded popup and keep the saved-profile picker open to retry, instead of only an easy-to-miss inline label -- mirrored on both lanes (BugpunchProfilePicker.showLoginErrorPopup / -showSignInError:).
- sdk(ios): ensure the Sign in with Apple entitlement survives automatic signing -- PostProcessBuild adds com.apple.developer.applesignin = [Default] and registers the AddSignInWithApple capability, fixing the entitlement being stripped from the signed binary.

## [0.8.87] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- sdk(scripting): ship ODDGames.Scripting as its own ODDGames.Scripting.dll instead of embedding + internalizing it into the Bugpunch runtime DLL. The VM is now a normal referenced dependency, bundled in package/Plugins (single Any-Platform DLL at the Plugins root) next to ODDGames.Bugpunch.dll. Also adds an embedded web IDE (ODDGames.Scripting.Ide.ScriptIde.Host) -- a loopback/LAN browser editor with file tree, full-text search, reflection-backed IntelliSense, a Run panel, and a visual UXML/USS designer (palette + hierarchy + properties + preview) with UXML-to-controller coupling and a shared USS convention.
- sdk(android,ios): a server-pushed tester role no longer overrides the launch auto-prompt gate -- maybeShowOnLaunch respects startMode and the cached-tester-profile-only contract (BugpunchTesterRoleManager.onRoleBecameTester and its iOS mirror).
- sdk(ios): credential sign-in keyboard handling -- the email field shifts above the on-screen keyboard via viewWillAppear + keyboard-frame observers, with an inline error label, mirroring the Android SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE fix.

## [0.8.86] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Storyboard/screenshot capture overhaul (iOS perf):
- - Storyboard no longer captures on every button press - navigation-confirm gate only captures on a real menu transition (menu-vs-play), removing the finger-up hitch
- - Lowered storyboard screenshot resolution 1080 -> 540 (seamless, ~1/4 the cost)
- - Removed the always-on iOS GPU mirror blit (recurring perf drop); crash/ANR/report screenshots now ride the GPU video frame while recording, a capture-on-request GPU one-shot, or the storyboard ring - render-freeze watchdog + permission-free GPU video preserved
- - Switched storyboard capture from main-thread drawViewHierarchyInRect to a capture-on-request GPU one-shot (off-main, ~0.2ms)
- - Renamed BugpunchBackbuffer -> BugpunchGpuCapture
- - Plus assorted SDK fixes/improvements (perf monitor, method profiler, shader watch, crash drain, config)

## [0.8.85] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Performance/heat + CPU pass, shader-error pattern cleanup, and Grouped Logs Phase 2 (NTP clock-sync).
- Performance / heat:
- - Removed shake-to-report entirely (dead feature — a 30Hz always-on accelerometer) on all lanes (iOS BPShake, Android BugpunchShakeDetector, C# config/wiring, docs).
- - iOS: removed the always-on OSLogStore 1s background poll; os_log is now pulled on demand at report/snapshot time only (no recurring thermal cost).
- - iOS: gated the overlay-box view-tree walk + its delayed snapshots to active recording sessions (was walking the UIKit tree + building JSON on every modal present, discarded unless recording).
- - Suppressed perf-event screenshots for public-role players on iOS + Android (the capture+upload was the heavy bit; the JSON perf event still uploads).
- - iOS: throttled the touch-recorder's per-event UIScreen.mainScreen read to ~1Hz on the input hot path.
- - Storyboard capture now skips the same button pressed back-to-back and frequently-mashed (gameplay input) buttons.
- CPU churn:
- - iOS per-Debug.Log hot path: removed the redundant client-side dedup (server collapses consecutive dup lines at ingest), replaced the per-line NSDateFormatter with gmtime_r+snprintf, and swapped the per-line dispatch_sync-to-serial-queue ring write for an os_unfair_lock.
- - Throttled BugpunchCanvasWatch's per-frame native role check to the 4Hz scan cadence (was a JNI/P-Invoke round-trip + allocs every frame for all device users).
- - BugpunchShaderWatch: added a LogType severity gate (shader/GPU errors are Warning+) and a cheap anchor-token pre-gate before the compiled-regex sweep.
- - Throttled ContextObjectCapture's render path so an Update() exception storm can't drive a 4-angle camera render + JPEG per frame.
- Shader/GPU error patterns (validated against real Unity/Metal/Vulkan/GL logs, with a server-side test suite):
- - Dropped the broad <Metal|OpenGL|Vulkan> ... error catch-alls, the prose device...lost/removed/reset matcher, and the ...stall token (no distinct real example; false-matched benign lines).
- - Fixed the OOM gap (now matches the real "Vulkan, Out of memory!"); added the real DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED/HUNG device-loss tokens.
- Grouped Logs (Phase 2):
- - NTP-style clock-sync over the report + IDE tunnels (clockSync frame -> clock_offset_ms / rtt_ms) so multi-device log sessions align on a common timeline. All lanes (iOS, Android, C#).

## [0.8.84] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Richer crash context: ContextObjectCapture now reflects serialized fields across every game script on the offending object (not just the throw-site component) and surfaces UnityEngine.Object references — sprites, meshes, materials, physics materials, audio/animation clips, GameObject/Component/ScriptableObject refs — with type-specific asset detail, plus arrays and Lists; bounded by field + per-collection element caps.

## [0.8.83] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Richer crash context: ContextObjectCapture now reflects serialized fields across every game script on the offending object (not just the throw-site component) and surfaces UnityEngine.Object references — sprites, meshes, materials, physics materials, audio/animation clips, GameObject/Component/ScriptableObject refs — with type-specific asset detail, plus arrays and Lists; bounded by field + per-collection element caps.

## [0.8.82] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Purchasing: compile against Unity IAP v4 (UnityEngine.Purchasing) as well as v5 (Unity.Purchasing) — fixes the optional purchasing shim failing to resolve its types on IAP 4.x projects (e.g. TOR @ 4.14.2)
- Goals: IAP + Ads goal categories always rank as Important in the on-device Goal HUD; editor Cecil scan carries the category literal through to the build catalog
- Scene camera: auto-hide screen-space game UI (uGUI Canvases + UIToolkit UIDocuments) while the scene camera is active so the free-fly view isn't obscured by the game HUD

## [0.8.81] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Method profiler: lead rows with the class (e.g. Ticker.Update), bake weave-time source file:line into each profiled site from the PDB, and deep-link it to the uploaded source bundle (click file:line -> inline source). Managed lane only; zero runtime cost.

## [0.8.80] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- iOS: handle silent (content-available) remote pushes. The server delivers data-only bounty / bug_found envelopes as background pushes, which land on application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler: rather than the UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate. Add-or-chain swizzle routes the `bugpunch` envelope into the in-app reward / triage flow (idempotent with the foreground-present, tap, and poll paths) and always finishes the fetch (or chains to the game's own handler).

## [0.8.79] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Fix: the Android AAR now bakes the correct SDK version. build-all.ps1 drives gradle directly (bypassing build-android.ps1), so it wasn't re-stamping BuildStamp.java — the v0.8.78 AAR shipped SDK_VERSION one release behind while the C# DLL and iOS xcframework were correct. Step 4 now writes BuildStamp.java from the already-bumped package.json before gradle, matching the C# and iOS lanes. (No runtime behaviour change beyond the corrected version string.)

## [0.8.78] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Android permission-free GPU video recording — replaces MediaProjection: C# blits the final frame into a shared RenderTexture, native encodes it straight off the GPU into an AMediaCodec ring (GLES3 + Vulkan paths). No screen-record permission, far lower CPU/heat.
- iOS GpuOnly capture is now the default and ReplayKit is removed from the ring recorder — permission-free backbuffer capture, with the sRGB darkness fix.
- 24fps recording floor + 480–720 short-edge resolution clamp on both lanes; proactive thermal throttle at 'fair' (sheds heat via bitrate/resolution, not framerate).
- No-permission in-game audio capture via a C# tap (pushed PCM to the native encoder).
- SDK version is now native-owned — baked from package.json into each lane at build time (Android BuildStamp, iOS BugpunchBuildStamp.h, C# BuildStamp), seeded before Unity boots so every report and the +load device register always carry it. Server now persists it to devices.sdk_version. No longer dependent on a C# config push.
- General native-overlay detection: Android enumerates WindowManager views, iOS hooks in-app presentations (ads / IAP / Bugpunch's own UI) — captures their bounding boxes so the dashboard can draw what native UI was on screen over the recording.
- iOS Metal GPU-error watch + reworked log/thermal capture (on-demand, no always-on OSLogStore drain).
- Removed recurring 60s poll — register on startup + foreground + push only.
- Native appVersion / identity derivation for the +load register (fixes register 400 / appVersion 0.0.0).

## [0.8.77] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Editor Remote IDE: Internal/External devices skip the consent gate — no more stuck "consent_required" 403 / long retry backoff on trusted editors (the prompt-based gate now applies only to Public-role editors)
- WebRTC streamer: on mobile, report a clear SDK error when the managed Unity.WebRTC streamer is unavailable instead of failing silently, and skip the desktop-plugin fallback on device (surfaces why iOS/Android streaming is null)
- Bounty: in-game leaderboard, "bug found" reward dialog, bounty hint, and a bounty test tool (C# + Android + iOS)
- Inbox: board + native Android/iOS updates
- Push: Android + iOS notification handling updates
- Canvas watch: track canvas state on the managed lane

## [0.8.76] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Bug bounties: the server can award a player a bounty for finding a NEW bug. Bugpunch.OnBountyEarned fires for the game and a native reward popup (BugpunchBountyDialog) shows the amount + redemption code, delivered via identity-targeted push / poll notifications. Mirrored across Editor+Standalone (C#), Android and iOS.
- Bounty + post-SSO notification plumbing: register the push token after SSO sign-in and route bounty deep-links through the shared notification path (Push / Poller / ProfilePicker / MessagingService) on every lane.
- Feedback + chat attachments now open through a short-lived signed /api/files URL, so the OS video player / browser authenticates and the clip plays instead of landing on the auth-gated login page. Previously a video attachment opened a bare auth-gated URL and 401'd. Fixed on Android, iOS and Editor+Standalone (C#).

## [0.8.75] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- Bug report form: Send now closes the form immediately and prepares + uploads the report on a detached background thread instead of blocking on a 'Sending report' spinner; the durable upload pill shows the real network Sending/sent status (failures surface as a toast). Mirrored on Android + iOS (native report form; no managed-lane analogue).

## [0.8.74] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- Standard UI navigation: shared nav host + back stack (BugpunchNav/BugpunchNavHeader/IBugpunchScreen) across all lanes; chat, feedback, inbox and issue-detail boards migrated onto it
- Release-build method profiler: IL-weaved BugpunchMethodProfiler + ProfilerSampler feed /perf/methods and the video-synced perf timeline
- Broken Shader detection: client-side BugpunchShaderWatch on all lanes posts a lightweight report; editor shader-log preprocessor support
- Perf monitor: richer native sampling on iOS + Android (mem/headroom/thermal counters, ProfilerRecorder bridge)
- Capture pill, feedback/inbox/chat board and crash/screenshot path refinements across iOS, Android and C#

## [0.8.73] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- Native crash symbolication: the IL2CPP method map now carries the declaring assembly + exact C# namespace (resolved at build time; genuinely ambiguous cases flagged rather than guessed), so symbolicated native frames read as Namespace.Class.Method — Assembly.
- iOS: the build now uploads the IL2CPP method map (keyed to the UnityFramework dSYM UUIDs) so iOS native crashes resolve to C# names + source lines, matching Android.
- SetUserId now persists across launches so a next-launch crash drain attributes a native crash to the same player id a live report would (Android + iOS).
- Upload queue: failed reports are retried across launches for up to 48h before being dropped, so a transient server outage no longer loses crashes (Android + iOS).

## [0.8.72] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- Deep native stacks: crash handlers now capture the fault-time register file (---REGISTERS---) plus a 128KB stack-memory snapshot (.stackmem) so the server can DWARF-CFI unwind past libunity/libil2cpp where the frame-pointer walk bottoms out. Android dumps in-signal via pread on /proc/self/mem; iOS dumps on the Mach-exception thread via vm_read_overwrite (registers only on the signal path). The drain/uploader ships .stackmem as a budget-gated phase-2 attachment.
- One fault, one issue: the ANR + GPU-hang watchdog now stands down while a crash is being handled (iOS s_crashing, Android isCrashing()), so a fatal crash no longer also files an ANR + a GPU-hang alongside the real report.
- Android: suppress false-positive ANRs while backgrounded - a full-screen interstitial/rewarded ad or the IAP billing sheet pushes a separate Activity, and a main-thread stall in that window is not a user-facing hang. Re-checked after the recheck delay too.
- Android: stop burning background CPU/GPU while the ring recorder is running - detach the encoder from the screen fan-out and idle the VirtualDisplay mirror (setSurface(null)) when it is the last consumer, fixing REASON_EXCESSIVE_RESOURCE_USAGE kills without the Android-14 "Reusing token" re-attach crash. Pre-background footage is retained.
- iOS: tapping a control inside the Tools panel (e.g. a category chip) no longer also dismisses the whole panel - the scrim gesture now ignores in-panel touches.
- C#: redraw the debug-widget inbox glyph as a stroked Feather icon that mirrors the native pill, and stop the "Report" button clipping its last glyph (flexShrink 0 + no-wrap).

## [0.8.71] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- Centralize in-game screenshot/video capture in a shared BugpunchCapturePill across all three lanes; reuse it from the chat, feedback, and issue-detail surfaces (Android + iOS + C#). Editor: tighten artifact/source upload postprocessors and build-fingerprint preprocessor.

## [0.8.70] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- Storyboard memory controls + Bugpunch.HintIdle()
- - Storyboard screenshot ring capped at 10 frames on every lane (C# managed ring 50→10; Android/iOS rings already 10), bounding runtime memory and upload/storage.
- - Storyboard capture is now optional via BugpunchConfig.storyboardEnabled (default ON) — gates capture on all lanes and rides the config blob to native.
- - Added Bugpunch.HintIdle(): call it on quiet moments (loading screens / game-mode changes) to let Bugpunch free memory. On the managed lane it PNG-packs the storyboard ring; native idle housekeeping + encode-on-tap-to-disk are tracked in bugpunch-sdk#62.

## [0.8.69] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- Native unified Inbox board on all lanes — Ask for help (chat) / Request a feature / Status of my bugs in one surface; fix the just-sent chat message not appearing in the inbox chat (merge the server's canonical message echo + non-destructive incremental read-back, and stamp the nested thread id).

## [0.8.68] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Bugpunch.RecordInput(label, screenPosition, path) - new public API to record a custom UI interaction onto the Storyboard rail for UI that doesn't flow through uGUI Selectable / UI Toolkit Button auto-capture (a game's own UIManager, in-world 3D buttons, gesture handlers). Captures a frame into the same native ring that feeds the "before" context shot + crash-rescue screenshot, so those stop being empty for games that never press a Unity UI Button. Throttled, fire-and-forget; native capture on device, RenderTexture readback in Editor, no-op on Standalone. Mirrored across C#, Android, and iOS (new BugpunchInput.mm)
- iOS input-breadcrumb parity: Bugpunch_PushInputTouch/PushInputKey/PushInputSceneChange/PushInputCustom now implemented on iOS (new BugpunchInput.mm), matching the Android BugpunchInput entry points - breadcrumbs were Android-only before
- Render-freeze / GPU-hang detection: new first-class gpu_hang issue type. The watchdog now checks how long since the last delivered vsync frame (Choreographer on Android, mirror of the iOS render-freeze check) - catches a frozen screen from a GPU hang (Vulkan VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST, GL context loss, wedged render thread) that keeps the main thread ticking and so would never trip a CPU-bound ANR. Drains as its own category with the freeze duration tagged, fingerprinting apart from ANRs. Mirrored Android + iOS
- Session-grouped replay (#314): root session id threaded through the crash/drain path on all lanes (rootSessionId in metadata + crash files) so the server can collate every event from a single playthrough
- SSO buttons live-refresh (#56): Google / Apple sign-in buttons appear on the profile picker the moment a poll flips their provider config from unconfigured to configured, without the user closing and reopening the picker (Android + iOS)
- Report form: "Sending report" overlay - the report is now prepared (video ring dump, screenshot encode, log gzip, manifest write) and handed to the upload queue off the UI thread behind a spinning scrim, instead of janking the main thread; the form then closes and the upload pill shows the true network sent status (Android + iOS)
- Android recorder: encoder is surface-input only - removed the dead startBufferMode/queueFrame CPU-readback entry points; if MediaProjection is denied the player sees an error and recording mode is not entered (no CPU fallback)
- Profile picker: Google "G" badge tile clipped to its circle so its white corners no longer poke past the oval (Android)

## [0.8.67] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Chat banner: stay dismissed � native dismiss-snooze watermark on both pollers so the "new message from a dev" banner no longer re-shows on every poll after the player taps X; it re-arms when chat is opened or a strictly-newer message arrives (Android + iOS)
- Chat banner: restyled to match the "Report sent" upload pill � near-black background, 25% white border, softer shadow (Android + iOS)
- iOS chat banner: center on the full window width at the top instead of the safe-area width (was off-center under a landscape notch)
- Notification badges: stop the unread-count pips being clipped at the button corners on the Android debug widget + report overlay (setClipChildren/ClipToPadding false on the badge hosts and their ancestors)

## [0.8.66] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Editor/Standalone chat board: add the "Solved?" resolution prompt (Yes it's solved / Not yet ? confirmed/reopened outcome line), matching the native Android + iOS chat boards
- Managed-lane SDK self-instrumentation: BugpunchNative.SetPerfInstrumented + BugpunchRuntime.SetInstrumentation mirror the active source into the managed runtime (and into native on device)
- WebRTC streamer marks the "stream" source as perf-instrumented while streaming so the perf monitor attributes load to the live stream

## [0.8.65] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Issue Detail view: open the full detail of an issue affecting you � new native board mirrored on all three lanes (C# BugpunchIssueDetailBoard / Android BugpunchIssueDetailDialog / iOS BugpunchIssueDetailViewController)
- "Issues affecting you" cards surfaced in the chat window; unread impacting issues now nudge the chat badge (badge = chat unread + impacting unread) while the chat banner stays tied to real unread chat messages (Poller bootstrap, all lanes)
- Feedback push deep-link: feedback_reply notifications open the feedback board straight to that item's detail (screen=feedback, params.feedbackItemId) on Android + iOS
- Chat and Feedback board rework across C#, Android, and iOS lanes

## [0.8.64] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- fix(ios): recording pill settings-cog menu rows now fire - scrim tap recognizer was cancelling row UIControl touches; added gesture delegate so only outside-card taps dismiss

## [0.8.63] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- sdk(ios): drop the orphaned WebRTC.xcframework. The C# Unity.WebRTC WebRTCStreamer owns live streaming on every lane (Editor/Standalone/iOS/Android), so no .mm imports <WebRTC/WebRTC.h> and nothing consumed the vendored libwebrtc � yet its .meta still embedded ~11MB of dead framework (a second libwebrtc beside the one com.unity.webrtc already ships) into every consumer iOS build. Removed the framework + .meta from Plugins/iOS, and the now-dead fetch/prune machinery (ensure_webrtc / prune_webrtc_slices + WEBRTC_* constants) from build-xcframework.sh. Bugpunch.xcframework carries no RTC* externs, so consumer link is unaffected.

## [0.8.62] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- sdk(ios,android): fix the just-sent chat message being hidden behind the composer.
- - iOS: force-stick to bottom on send; re-pin after self-sizing cells measure their true height (the estimated-height first scroll landed short, leaving the newest bubble clipped under the send bar); re-scroll after the keyboard show/hide animation so focusing the composer doesn't strand the latest message.
- - Android: explicit setSelection(last) on send so stackFromBottom / transcript-mode timing or the IME-hide reflow can't leave the sender's own message below the fold.

## [0.8.61] - 2026-06-05

### Changed
- sdk(csharp,android,ios): virtualized, bottom-up chat message list with scroll-up history on every lane.
- - Editor+Standalone (C#): fix the Yoga flex-shrink collapse that squashed every bubble into overlapping ovals (flexShrink=0 on rows/bubbles/separators); replace the flat ScrollView with a virtualized DynamicHeight ListView -- opens on the newest message, scroll up loads older history a page at a time, new messages auto-scroll only when already at the bottom.
- - Android: ScrollView+LinearLayout -> virtualized ListView (BaseAdapter view recycling, no new androidx dependency); setStackFromBottom + TRANSCRIPT_MODE_NORMAL give bottom-up + sticky; reuses buildBubble/buildInfoRow.
- - iOS: UIScrollView+column -> virtualized UITableView with self-sizing cells, bottom-aligned via top inset, sticky-to-newest; reuses buildBubbleRow.
- sdk(csharp,editor): managed-lane debug-pill "Report" action opens the Editor F12 capture dialog (new BugpunchEditorReportBridge wires BugpunchClient.EditorReportHandler -> BugpunchEditorQuickTaskDialog; native reporting is device-only so the pill would otherwise no-op in Editor).

## [0.8.60] - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Editor + Standalone now get the full Bugpunch debug experience � a floating pill with live chat, debug tools, feedback and sign-in.
- sdk(csharp): managed-lane (Editor + Standalone) floating debug pill in UIToolkit, mirroring the native Android/iOS pill � Report + Chat (icon) + an overflow menu (Tools, Chat, Feedback, Switch profile, Exit), draggable, with the menu anchored below the pill.
- sdk(csharp): managed-lane UIToolkit chat board � full /api/v1/chat/* parity (single per-device thread, 5s polling, message bubbles, send, hours/disabled states, read tracking, image thumbnails).
- sdk(csharp): managed-lane UIToolkit Debug Tools panel � renders the same DebugButton/DebugToggle/DebugSlider + dashboard-defined tools the native panel shows, routed through DebugToolsBridge.
- sdk(csharp): Editor real Bugpunch login + 120-day session + server-signed tester role (defaults Internal in-Editor only, never on a shipped Standalone build). The Enable Connection toolbar toggle now defaults OFF, prompts sign-in when enabled, validates on Play, and auto-disables if the session is invalid. Styled login window + toolbar pill + right-click Sign Out.
- sdk(csharp): fix the Editor enable-toggle being a no-op in the runtime DLL � the gate sat behind a UNITY_EDITOR guard stripped from the runtime build, so the SDK connected regardless. Now an always-compiled Application.isEditor gate reading a PlayerPrefs mirror of the toggle, so turning it off actually stops the SDK.
- sdk(csharp): fix the F12 Editor report screenshot preview rendering offset � use an Image + ScaleToFit so it centres like the video preview.
- sdk(csharp,ios): WebRTC streaming moved to Unity.WebRTC on every lane (Editor, Standalone, iOS, Android); retired the native iOS BugpunchStreamer + vendored WebRTC.xcframework. GPU H.264 where available, software VP8 fallback.
- sdk(csharp): Switch / add profile from the pill opens the real Editor login via a static-delegate bridge; no-op notice on Standalone, which has no sign-in surface.

## [0.8.59] - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Chat now follows your account across devices, with instant dev-message notifications.
- - chat(all lanes,server): user-based threads � a signed-in player's chat keys to their account (player_email), not the device, so it follows them across devices/reinstalls. iOS now sends the player email in the POST body (was header-only); server falls back to the X-Player-Email header so already-shipped clients are fixed too; unread badge resolves the user's thread. Presence window 5->2min; online status shows the device(s) the player is currently on.
- - chat(all lanes,server): real-time in-app notifications � QA replies push a chatNotify frame down the open report tunnel so the banner appears in ~1s instead of waiting up to 30s for the next poll. Poll path kept as the idle/public fallback.
- - chat(ios): fix image-only messages collapsing into the corner; top notification banners centre within the safe area and sit at the top.
- - sdk(ios): safe-area across all native UI (chat, feedback, report/annotation, tools panel, sign-in, crash overlay).
- - sdk(ios): live WebRTC streamer parity with Android � FPS governor, resolution clamp-to-tier, constrained-High H.264, thermal bitrate cap.
- - sdk(csharp): removed the com.unity.webrtc dependency � the SDK ships its own native WebRTC. The managed lane now drives the native BugpunchWebRTC desktop plugin via NativeDesktopStreamer; until that binary ships (#59) Editor/Standalone streaming degrades cleanly. Fixes a dual-libwebrtc-framework iOS link conflict.
- - sdk(csharp): fix BugpunchWebRtcNative namespace shadowing the public Bugpunch API class.

## [0.8.58] - 2026-06-02

### Changed
- sdk: v0.8.57 - sdk(ios): fix GetTesterRole heap-corruption crash (SIGABRT on Request Help). Bugpunch_GetTesterRole / GetStableDeviceId / TunnelDeviceId were declared `extern string`, so the IL2CPP marshaler free()'d the returned const char* � but the native side returns a BORROWED pointer (NSString UTF8String / internal static cache), so freeing it is a bad-free/double-free ? heap corruption ? SIGABRT (symbolicated stack pinned it to BugpunchNative_GetTesterRole, hit on every Request Help tap). Now declared IntPtr and copied via Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi, which never frees. GetInstallerMode stays `string` � it strdup()s, so the marshaler freeing it is correct.
- ?sdk: v0.8.56 - sdk(ios): fix dSYM symbol upload for large debug symbols. iOSSymbolUploadHook's build-phase uploader only PUT a single S3 part, so any dSYM larger than the 64MB part size � i.e. every real UnityFramework dSYM (~800MB) � failed CompleteMultipartUpload and never registered. The server was therefore missing the symbols and returned unsymbolicated iOS crash stacks (affected all consumers incl. MTD). Now does proper S3 multipart: parses the /init response with plutil, cuts each part with dd, PUTs every part, and /completes with all part ETags.
- ?sdk: v0.8.55 - sdk(ios): PostProcessBuild now links UserNotifications, PhotosUI, OSLog and libz � without them the static Bugpunch lib failed to link into consumer iOS builds (Undefined symbols for arm64: UN*, PHPicker*, OSLogStore, gz*).
- ?sdk: v0.8.54
- ?sdk: v0.8.53
- ?sdk: v0.8.52 - In-game chat popup � see a new dev message instantly, wherever you are.
- ?sdk: v0.8.51 - Chat notifications now reach logged-in players fast, and only when they need them.
- ?sdk: v0.8.50 - sdk(android,ios): hard-gate debug-mode entry on a valid SAVED profile (not just a cached role).
- ?sdk: v0.8.49 - sdk(android,ios): fix logged-in profile not saved as a tester (role read from the wrong place in the signed roleConfig).
- ?sdk: v0.8.48 - sdk(android): fix FCM push crash (firebase-messaging missing from consumer classpath) + report-tunnel reconnect storm.
- ?sdk: v0.8.47
- ?sdk: v0.8.46 - sdk(android,ios): chat-notification tap opens the chat board, and push works without debug mode.
- ?sdk: v0.8.45 - sdk(android,ios): pill overflow button is now a settings (gear) icon instead of "�".
- ?sdk: v0.8.44 - sdk(android,ios): pill overflow menu + 3-way exit + tester-only launch prompt.
- ?sdk: v0.8.43 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): sliding 120-day session-token login (#309) � fixes "logins always expired".
- ?sdk: v0.8.42
- ?sdk: v0.8.41 - sdk: profile picker � validate against the server on selection; always-show Google/Apple; drop the Back button.
- ?sdk: v0.8.40 - sdk(csharp): RequestHelp() is the single entry point and does both actions by role. Internal/external testers ? enter debug mode directly (no profile picker, no help card; EnterDebugMode is a no-op if already recording). Public/unknown ? profile picker / login, then if the login resolves a tester role debug mode is engaged via the picker-login path (card skipped), else the request-help card shows. The game only needs to call Bugpunch.RequestHelp().
- ?sdk: v0.8.39 - sdk: picker/login now deterministically enters debug mode for internal/external testers. At the profile-picker login-success (BugpunchProfilePicker applyIdentity, both native lanes), if the resolved role is internal/external, call the idempotent StartAutoRecording (starts the ring + shows the debug widget). Previously this relied on the becameTester role transition, which only fires on a public?tester change and could be missed (already-cached tester / role-apply ordering). Guarded on the auto-prompt one-shot callback (gBPPickerOnAuthSuccess / sOnAuthSuccessOneShot) so an EnterDebugMode / launch auto-prompt login � which owns debug-entry via its own consent?ring callback � doesn't double-start. Plain logins (request-help, profile switch) get debug mode directly.
- ?sdk: v0.8.38 - sdk: Request Help is public-only � internal/external testers go straight to debug mode, no help card.
- ?sdk: v0.8.37 - sdk: cross-lane parity batch (report tunnel gating, SSO button gating, iOS crash video).
- ?sdk: v0.8.36 - sdk(ios): fix login + SSO + analytics + push parity with Android (mirror audit).
- ?sdk: v0.8.35 - sdk(ios): fix push notification link failure � Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId was declared `extern` (C++-mangled) in BugpunchPush.mm but BugpunchTunnel defines it `extern "C"`, so v0.8.34 failed to link into game builds (Undefined symbols for arm64: Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId, referenced from BPPushDeviceId). Now declared `extern "C"` to match.
- ?sdk: v0.8.34 - sdk(android,ios): native push notifications (server#308). FCM on Android (BugpunchMessagingService + BugpunchPush: notification channel, permission, tap intents) and APNs on iOS (UIApplicationDelegate swizzling for device-token capture, UNUserNotificationCenter for receive + tap). Push token is registered to the server from shared BugpunchRuntime state. Mobile-only, no Editor/Standalone lane. Manifest + Gradle wiring added.
- ?sdk: v0.8.33 - sdk(ios): fix launch hang / boot loop on the +load path � BugpunchTouch_Start read UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds/scale synchronously on the main thread, but Bugpunch_StartDebugMode runs from the +load bootstrap (before UIApplicationMain). Touching UIScreen before the app has connected to the window server blocks the main thread forever waiting on a frontboard connection that isn't up yet, so the iOS launch watchdog killed the app as a stuck process � a repeating boot loop. The sendEvent: swizzle stays synchronous (pure objc-runtime, safe at +load); the UIScreen capture-size seed is now deferred via dispatch_async to the main queue (RecordTouches refreshes the size on every touch anyway). Found via the [BP-BOOT] launch instrumentation from 0.8.32, which stays in for one confirming run and gets stripped next release.
- ?sdk: v0.8.32
- ?sdk: v0.8.31
- ?sdk: v0.8.30 - sdk(csharp): goals are now text-as-key � the first string is both the goal key AND the dashboard label; the separate snake-case id arg is gone (goals are per-build, so rewording between builds is fine). The declare and observe forms collapse into one Goal(text, value[, () => eval]) call, and a new no-enum multi-step overload Goal(text, string[] steps, () => currentStep) reports progress as currentStep/steps.Length � including goals that only complete across an app restart (a step that can't be observed until a later launch, e.g. "earned coins survive a relaunch"). The enum-anchored multi-step form is removed. The build-time Cecil scanner was reworked to extract text-as-key goals and inline string[] step arrays, and now correctly skips capturing, cached non-capturing, and async evaluator lambdas; dynamic-id emits are skipped silently instead of failing the build.
- ?sdk: v0.8.29 - sdk(android,ios): auto-start MediaProjection recording on tester-role resolution. startAutoRecording now fires from the single role-resolution path (login, server push, launch auto-prompt) the moment a player lands on a tester tier (internal/external); idempotent, still gated behind the OS MediaProjection consent dialog, torn down on return to public.
- ?sdk: v0.8.28
- ?sdk: v0.8.27
- ?sdk: v0.8.26
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.25

- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.21
- ?sdk: v0.8.20
- sdk(editor): fix CS0029 � AssemblyReloadCallback isn't Action; make TryUnhookStatic generic
- sdk(editor): also unhook Unity.WebRTC's after-assembly-reload handler
- ?sdk: v0.8.19
- sdk: preprocessor warn-not-fail + retries; build-all.ps1 reuses iOS CI when src unchanged
- ?sdk: v0.8.18 - sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion � enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- ?sdk: v0.8.17 - sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked � there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.
- ?sdk: v0.8.16 - sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check � #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- ?sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched � mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- ?sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 � BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there. The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim. The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path � its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- ?sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter � replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 � 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- ?sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error � migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit � new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- ?sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled � EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- ?sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching � BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig � they now live in the dashboard (Settings ? SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` ? `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId � the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim � per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI

## [0.8.57] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix GetTesterRole heap-corruption crash (SIGABRT on Request Help). Bugpunch_GetTesterRole / GetStableDeviceId / TunnelDeviceId were declared `extern string`, so the IL2CPP marshaler free()'d the returned const char* � but the native side returns a BORROWED pointer (NSString UTF8String / internal static cache), so freeing it is a bad-free/double-free ? heap corruption ? SIGABRT (symbolicated stack pinned it to BugpunchNative_GetTesterRole, hit on every Request Help tap). Now declared IntPtr and copied via Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi, which never frees. GetInstallerMode stays `string` � it strdup()s, so the marshaler freeing it is correct.

## [0.8.56] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix dSYM symbol upload for large debug symbols. iOSSymbolUploadHook's build-phase uploader only PUT a single S3 part, so any dSYM larger than the 64MB part size � i.e. every real UnityFramework dSYM (~800MB) � failed CompleteMultipartUpload and never registered. The server was therefore missing the symbols and returned unsymbolicated iOS crash stacks (affected all consumers incl. MTD). Now does proper S3 multipart: parses the /init response with plutil, cuts each part with dd, PUTs every part, and /completes with all part ETags.

## [0.8.55] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- sdk(ios): PostProcessBuild now links UserNotifications, PhotosUI, OSLog and libz � without them the static Bugpunch lib failed to link into consumer iOS builds (Undefined symbols for arm64: UN*, PHPicker*, OSLogStore, gz*).
- sdk(ios): crash handler MAX_MODULES 128 -> 1024. A Unity/IL2CPP app loads 250-400+ dylibs (system libs first in dyld order), so at 128 the image table filled with system dylibs and truncated out UnityFramework/UIKitCore � exactly the frames needed to symbolicate a crash. Native crash reports now carry the full image table and symbolicate. Logs a warning if ever exceeded.
- sdk(ios): [BP-DIAG] memory breadcrumbs (used/available footprint) on the Request Help / report path for crash-vs-OOM diagnosis.

- ?sdk: v0.8.43 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): sliding 120-day session-token login (#309) � fixes "logins always expired".
- ?sdk: v0.8.42
- ?sdk: v0.8.41 - sdk: profile picker � validate against the server on selection; always-show Google/Apple; drop the Back button.
- ?sdk: v0.8.40 - sdk(csharp): RequestHelp() is the single entry point and does both actions by role. Internal/external testers ? enter debug mode directly (no profile picker, no help card; EnterDebugMode is a no-op if already recording). Public/unknown ? profile picker / login, then if the login resolves a tester role debug mode is engaged via the picker-login path (card skipped), else the request-help card shows. The game only needs to call Bugpunch.RequestHelp().
- ?sdk: v0.8.39 - sdk: picker/login now deterministically enters debug mode for internal/external testers. At the profile-picker login-success (BugpunchProfilePicker applyIdentity, both native lanes), if the resolved role is internal/external, call the idempotent StartAutoRecording (starts the ring + shows the debug widget). Previously this relied on the becameTester role transition, which only fires on a public?tester change and could be missed (already-cached tester / role-apply ordering). Guarded on the auto-prompt one-shot callback (gBPPickerOnAuthSuccess / sOnAuthSuccessOneShot) so an EnterDebugMode / launch auto-prompt login � which owns debug-entry via its own consent?ring callback � doesn't double-start. Plain logins (request-help, profile switch) get debug mode directly.
- ?sdk: v0.8.38 - sdk: Request Help is public-only � internal/external testers go straight to debug mode, no help card.
- ?sdk: v0.8.37 - sdk: cross-lane parity batch (report tunnel gating, SSO button gating, iOS crash video).
- ?sdk: v0.8.36 - sdk(ios): fix login + SSO + analytics + push parity with Android (mirror audit).
- ?sdk: v0.8.35 - sdk(ios): fix push notification link failure � Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId was declared `extern` (C++-mangled) in BugpunchPush.mm but BugpunchTunnel defines it `extern "C"`, so v0.8.34 failed to link into game builds (Undefined symbols for arm64: Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId, referenced from BPPushDeviceId). Now declared `extern "C"` to match.
- ?sdk: v0.8.34 - sdk(android,ios): native push notifications (server#308). FCM on Android (BugpunchMessagingService + BugpunchPush: notification channel, permission, tap intents) and APNs on iOS (UIApplicationDelegate swizzling for device-token capture, UNUserNotificationCenter for receive + tap). Push token is registered to the server from shared BugpunchRuntime state. Mobile-only, no Editor/Standalone lane. Manifest + Gradle wiring added.
- ?sdk: v0.8.33 - sdk(ios): fix launch hang / boot loop on the +load path � BugpunchTouch_Start read UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds/scale synchronously on the main thread, but Bugpunch_StartDebugMode runs from the +load bootstrap (before UIApplicationMain). Touching UIScreen before the app has connected to the window server blocks the main thread forever waiting on a frontboard connection that isn't up yet, so the iOS launch watchdog killed the app as a stuck process � a repeating boot loop. The sendEvent: swizzle stays synchronous (pure objc-runtime, safe at +load); the UIScreen capture-size seed is now deferred via dispatch_async to the main queue (RecordTouches refreshes the size on every touch anyway). Found via the [BP-BOOT] launch instrumentation from 0.8.32, which stays in for one confirming run and gets stripped next release.
- ?sdk: v0.8.32
- ?sdk: v0.8.31
- ?sdk: v0.8.30 - sdk(csharp): goals are now text-as-key � the first string is both the goal key AND the dashboard label; the separate snake-case id arg is gone (goals are per-build, so rewording between builds is fine). The declare and observe forms collapse into one Goal(text, value[, () => eval]) call, and a new no-enum multi-step overload Goal(text, string[] steps, () => currentStep) reports progress as currentStep/steps.Length � including goals that only complete across an app restart (a step that can't be observed until a later launch, e.g. "earned coins survive a relaunch"). The enum-anchored multi-step form is removed. The build-time Cecil scanner was reworked to extract text-as-key goals and inline string[] step arrays, and now correctly skips capturing, cached non-capturing, and async evaluator lambdas; dynamic-id emits are skipped silently instead of failing the build.
- ?sdk: v0.8.29 - sdk(android,ios): auto-start MediaProjection recording on tester-role resolution. startAutoRecording now fires from the single role-resolution path (login, server push, launch auto-prompt) the moment a player lands on a tester tier (internal/external); idempotent, still gated behind the OS MediaProjection consent dialog, torn down on return to public.

- ?sdk: v0.8.19
- sdk: preprocessor warn-not-fail + retries; build-all.ps1 reuses iOS CI when src unchanged
- ?sdk: v0.8.18 - sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion � enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- ?sdk: v0.8.17 - sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked � there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.
- ?sdk: v0.8.16 - sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check � #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- ?sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched � mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- ?sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 � BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there. The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim. The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path � its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- ?sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter � replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 � 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- ?sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error � migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit � new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- ?sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled � EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- ?sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching � BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig � they now live in the dashboard (Settings ? SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` ? `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId � the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim � per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup

## [0.8.52] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- In-game chat popup � see a new dev message instantly, wherever you are.
- - Chat is now always delivered via push, so a message sent from the dashboard reaches the player in every app state. (The live tunnel dropped these frames and the 60s poll is paused in debug mode, so the popup never fired there before.)
- - The in-app popup shows the sender + message preview and stays up until you tap it (opens chat) or tap the X to dismiss � like the upload banner.
- - Added a chat icon to the debug pill with an unread badge; the settings button keeps its unread dot.
- - Tapping a background notification opens the chat thread directly.
- - iOS: a foregrounded chat shows the in-app banner (not the OS banner); both platforms now behave the same.

## [0.8.51] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- Chat notifications now reach logged-in players fast, and only when they need them.
- - Android FCM is sent as a data-only high-priority message so the SDK receives every chat in any app state and controls display itself.
- - New chat while the chat board is open -> no alert (you are already reading it).
- - New chat while the game is foreground but the board is closed -> in-app banner (works even if OS notifications are disabled).
- - New chat while backgrounded -> OS notification whose tap deep-links straight into the chat thread.
- - Android: request POST_NOTIFICATIONS at runtime (Android 13+) so the tray notification shows without a manual grant.
- - iOS: suppress the foreground notification banner while the chat board is open.
- Branded dialogs: every player-facing prompt now uses the Bugpunch-styled BugpunchAlert (Android + iOS) instead of the stock OS alert.
- - Removing the currently signed-in profile now warns that it signs you out and turns off Bugpunch for the session.

## [0.8.50] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): hard-gate debug-mode entry on a valid SAVED profile (not just a cached role).
- Entering debug � BugpunchDebugMode.enter() / Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, the chokepoint every trigger funnels through (RequestHelp, shake, push directive, server roleConfig push) � now requires hasValidTesterProfile(): a picker-history profile whose role is internal/external AND whose 120-day session token is present and not expired. With no valid saved profile it routes to the login picker instead of entering debug, so a cached or server-pushed tester role can no longer open debug without a real logged-in account. The becameTester server-role auto-start is gated the same way. Fresh login -> debug is preserved (the post-login path gates on the freshly-resolved role after the profile is saved, not a hasValidTesterProfile re-read). Transport-only paths (report/IDE tunnel) are intentionally not gated.

## [0.8.49] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): fix logged-in profile not saved as a tester (role read from the wrong place in the signed roleConfig).
- On login (applyIdentity / BPPickerApplyIdentity) the role written onto the picker-history row was read via roleConfig.optString("role") / roleConfig[@"role"] � but the role lives in the SIGNED base64 payload, NOT the top-level field (verifyRoleConfig deliberately ignores the untrusted top-level "role"). So the history row was ALWAYS saved with role="" ? hasPrivilegedRoleInHistory() stayed false ? the launch auto-prompt never fired and the picker never recognised the logged-in profile as a tester, even though the separately-cached mTesterRole still drove RequestHelp -> debug. That looked like "debug works but there's no valid profile / profiles expiring" � but the session token was being stored fine all along; only the role was missing. Now reads the verified role back via BugpunchTunnel.getTesterRole() / Bugpunch_GetTesterRole() after applyRoleConfig, so the saved profile carries the real internal/external role alongside its 120-day token.

## [0.8.48] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk(android): fix FCM push crash (firebase-messaging missing from consumer classpath) + report-tunnel reconnect storm.
- (1) PUSH: firebase-messaging:24.1.0 is referenced by BugpunchPlugin.aar at compile time but was never carried onto the consumer APK's runtime classpath � the bugpunch_sso.androidlib dependency-carrier listed the SSO stack but not FCM. So BugpunchPush.ensureFirebaseApp() threw NoClassDefFoundError (com.google.firebase.FirebaseOptions$Builder) the moment a push config arrived from the server, and no FCM token ever registered. Added firebase-messaging to the androidlib so the class lands in the APK.
- (2) TUNNEL: BugpunchTunnel.connect() wasn't synchronized, so the cold-start path (start->connect) and the poll path (poller->connectIfAllowed->connect) both raced past the `mSocket != null` guard (TOCTOU) and each opened a report-tunnel for the same deviceId. The server evicted one ("Replaced by reconnect", close 1000) and both reconnected ~1-3x/sec forever. connect() is now synchronized and mSocket volatile, so exactly one socket is ever created.

## [0.8.47] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk: v0.8.46 - sdk(android,ios): chat-notification tap opens the chat board, and push works without debug mode.
- ?sdk: v0.8.45 - sdk(android,ios): pill overflow button is now a settings (gear) icon instead of "�".
- ?sdk: v0.8.44 - sdk(android,ios): pill overflow menu + 3-way exit + tester-only launch prompt.
- ?sdk: v0.8.43 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): sliding 120-day session-token login (#309) � fixes "logins always expired".
- ?sdk: v0.8.42
- ?sdk: v0.8.41 - sdk: profile picker � validate against the server on selection; always-show Google/Apple; drop the Back button.
- ?sdk: v0.8.40 - sdk(csharp): RequestHelp() is the single entry point and does both actions by role. Internal/external testers ? enter debug mode directly (no profile picker, no help card; EnterDebugMode is a no-op if already recording). Public/unknown ? profile picker / login, then if the login resolves a tester role debug mode is engaged via the picker-login path (card skipped), else the request-help card shows. The game only needs to call Bugpunch.RequestHelp().
- ?sdk: v0.8.39 - sdk: picker/login now deterministically enters debug mode for internal/external testers. At the profile-picker login-success (BugpunchProfilePicker applyIdentity, both native lanes), if the resolved role is internal/external, call the idempotent StartAutoRecording (starts the ring + shows the debug widget). Previously this relied on the becameTester role transition, which only fires on a public?tester change and could be missed (already-cached tester / role-apply ordering). Guarded on the auto-prompt one-shot callback (gBPPickerOnAuthSuccess / sOnAuthSuccessOneShot) so an EnterDebugMode / launch auto-prompt login � which owns debug-entry via its own consent?ring callback � doesn't double-start. Plain logins (request-help, profile switch) get debug mode directly.
- ?sdk: v0.8.38 - sdk: Request Help is public-only � internal/external testers go straight to debug mode, no help card.
- ?sdk: v0.8.37 - sdk: cross-lane parity batch (report tunnel gating, SSO button gating, iOS crash video).
- ?sdk: v0.8.36 - sdk(ios): fix login + SSO + analytics + push parity with Android (mirror audit).
- ?sdk: v0.8.35 - sdk(ios): fix push notification link failure � Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId was declared `extern` (C++-mangled) in BugpunchPush.mm but BugpunchTunnel defines it `extern "C"`, so v0.8.34 failed to link into game builds (Undefined symbols for arm64: Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId, referenced from BPPushDeviceId). Now declared `extern "C"` to match.
- ?sdk: v0.8.34 - sdk(android,ios): native push notifications (server#308). FCM on Android (BugpunchMessagingService + BugpunchPush: notification channel, permission, tap intents) and APNs on iOS (UIApplicationDelegate swizzling for device-token capture, UNUserNotificationCenter for receive + tap). Push token is registered to the server from shared BugpunchRuntime state. Mobile-only, no Editor/Standalone lane. Manifest + Gradle wiring added.
- ?sdk: v0.8.33 - sdk(ios): fix launch hang / boot loop on the +load path � BugpunchTouch_Start read UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds/scale synchronously on the main thread, but Bugpunch_StartDebugMode runs from the +load bootstrap (before UIApplicationMain). Touching UIScreen before the app has connected to the window server blocks the main thread forever waiting on a frontboard connection that isn't up yet, so the iOS launch watchdog killed the app as a stuck process � a repeating boot loop. The sendEvent: swizzle stays synchronous (pure objc-runtime, safe at +load); the UIScreen capture-size seed is now deferred via dispatch_async to the main queue (RecordTouches refreshes the size on every touch anyway). Found via the [BP-BOOT] launch instrumentation from 0.8.32, which stays in for one confirming run and gets stripped next release.
- ?sdk: v0.8.32
- ?sdk: v0.8.31
- ?sdk: v0.8.30 - sdk(csharp): goals are now text-as-key � the first string is both the goal key AND the dashboard label; the separate snake-case id arg is gone (goals are per-build, so rewording between builds is fine). The declare and observe forms collapse into one Goal(text, value[, () => eval]) call, and a new no-enum multi-step overload Goal(text, string[] steps, () => currentStep) reports progress as currentStep/steps.Length � including goals that only complete across an app restart (a step that can't be observed until a later launch, e.g. "earned coins survive a relaunch"). The enum-anchored multi-step form is removed. The build-time Cecil scanner was reworked to extract text-as-key goals and inline string[] step arrays, and now correctly skips capturing, cached non-capturing, and async evaluator lambdas; dynamic-id emits are skipped silently instead of failing the build.
- ?sdk: v0.8.29 - sdk(android,ios): auto-start MediaProjection recording on tester-role resolution. startAutoRecording now fires from the single role-resolution path (login, server push, launch auto-prompt) the moment a player lands on a tester tier (internal/external); idempotent, still gated behind the OS MediaProjection consent dialog, torn down on return to public.
- ?sdk: v0.8.28

- sdk(editor): fix CS0029 � AssemblyReloadCallback isn't Action; make TryUnhookStatic generic
- sdk(editor): also unhook Unity.WebRTC's after-assembly-reload handler
- ?sdk: v0.8.19
- sdk: preprocessor warn-not-fail + retries; build-all.ps1 reuses iOS CI when src unchanged
- ?sdk: v0.8.18 - sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion � enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- ?sdk: v0.8.17 - sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked � there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.
- ?sdk: v0.8.16 - sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check � #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- ?sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched � mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- ?sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 � BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there. The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim. The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path � its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- ?sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter � replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 � 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- ?sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error � migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit � new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- ?sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled � EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- ?sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching � BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig � they now live in the dashboard (Settings ? SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` ? `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId � the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim � per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup

## [0.8.46] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): chat-notification tap opens the chat board, and push works without debug mode.
- Tapping a chat push now opens the native chat board (was a #29 placeholder that only foregrounded the app). The deep-link threadId is parsed + carried; the player board is single-thread-per-device so it opens that device's conversation (true multi-thread deep-select is a documented TODO). Push init + token registration are now ALWAYS-ON for every user on iOS � moved off the debug-mode-entry coupling onto the always-on poll launch path, mirroring Android (already ungated via the ContentProvider + poller) � so dormant / public / non-debug players can receive chat pushes. Adds an iOS token-register retry on device-registration success to cover the APNs-token-before-device-token race.

## [0.8.45] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): pill overflow button is now a settings (gear) icon instead of "�".
- Android renders the Feather "settings" glyph via BugpunchToolsOverlay.FeatherIcon; iOS uses the SF Symbol "gearshape" (? text fallback on < iOS 13). Same button � still opens the overflow menu (Tools / Chat / Feedback / Switch�add profile / Exit) and keeps the aggregate unread dot. No behavior change.

## [0.8.44] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): pill overflow menu + 3-way exit + tester-only launch prompt.
- The floating debug pill keeps the recording dot + "Report" as one-tap primaries and collapses Tools / Chat / Feedback into a "�" overflow menu, which also adds "Switch / add profile" (opens the profile picker on demand) and "Exit debug mode". Exit opens a themed 3-way sheet: "Turn off this session" (stop recording + hide the pill for this run), "Turn off until I start it again" (same, plus a persisted suppress flag), or Cancel. The launch auto-prompt now shows the picker at startup ONLY when the local cache holds a tester profile (internal/external) � regular players are never interrupted; the persisted suppress flag short-circuits the prompt + auto-record until the tester explicitly re-enters debug mode (which clears it). The "�" carries an aggregate unread dot so collapsing chat/feedback doesn't hide unread.

## [0.8.43] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios,csharp): sliding 120-day session-token login (#309) � fixes "logins always expired".
- The profile picker now trusts a locally-stored 120-day sliding session token instead of re-listing from the server. On open it prunes the cached profile list by each token's locally-decoded JWT exp with NO network round-trip � the /profiles/top fetch-on-open is removed on all three lanes (and the server route deleted). Selecting a profile POSTs { sessionToken } to /profiles/select (was { userId }); on success it overwrites the stored token with the server's freshly re-issued one (sliding the 120-day window) and applies the current role; on 401 it clears that token and re-prompts sign-in. Sign-in (sso-sign-in) persists the minted token. The C# lane mirrors the token storage + JWT-exp prune primitive in BugpunchRuntime.

## [0.8.42] - 2026-05-31

### Changed
- sdk: v0.8.41 - sdk: profile picker � validate against the server on selection; always-show Google/Apple; drop the Back button.

The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim. The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path � its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- ?sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter � replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 � 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- ?sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error � migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit � new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- ?sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled � EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- ?sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching � BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig � they now live in the dashboard (Settings ? SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` ? `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId � the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim � per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup

## [0.8.41] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- sdk: profile picker � validate against the server on selection; always-show Google/Apple; drop the Back button.
- - Selecting a saved profile now POSTs /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/profiles/select (X-Api-Key + X-Device-Token, body {userId}) and applies the freshly-signed roleConfig from the response, instead of applying a stale locally-cached role. So an already-logged-in Bugpunch profile re-validates ? resolves internal ? enters debug mode, no 3-panel. 403 (not authed on this device) falls back to the login state; network/other errors show an inline error and keep the picker open. The local cache is now display-only (this tool requires internet). Both lanes.
- - SSO buttons are always shown (removed the isConfigured()/configuredClientId gating that was hiding the Google option on Android); an unconfigured provider surfaces a clear error on tap. Both lanes.
- - Removed the "Back to profiles" button from the login state � the X (close) button is the single dismiss affordance. Both lanes.

## [0.8.40] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- sdk(csharp): RequestHelp() is the single entry point and does both actions by role. Internal/external testers ? enter debug mode directly (no profile picker, no help card; EnterDebugMode is a no-op if already recording). Public/unknown ? profile picker / login, then if the login resolves a tester role debug mode is engaged via the picker-login path (card skipped), else the request-help card shows. The game only needs to call Bugpunch.RequestHelp().

## [0.8.39] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- sdk: picker/login now deterministically enters debug mode for internal/external testers. At the profile-picker login-success (BugpunchProfilePicker applyIdentity, both native lanes), if the resolved role is internal/external, call the idempotent StartAutoRecording (starts the ring + shows the debug widget). Previously this relied on the becameTester role transition, which only fires on a public?tester change and could be missed (already-cached tester / role-apply ordering). Guarded on the auto-prompt one-shot callback (gBPPickerOnAuthSuccess / sOnAuthSuccessOneShot) so an EnterDebugMode / launch auto-prompt login � which owns debug-entry via its own consent?ring callback � doesn't double-start. Plain logins (request-help, profile switch) get debug mode directly.

## [0.8.38] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- sdk: Request Help is public-only � internal/external testers go straight to debug mode, no help card.
- - C# BugpunchRequestHelpPicker: keeps showing the profile picker / login first, then branches on the resolved role in the post-login handler � internal/external testers skip the help card (debug mode is engaged via the tester role-resolution path); only public users see the 3-choice card.
- - Android BugpunchReportOverlay.showRequestHelp + iOS Bugpunch_ShowRequestHelp: authoritative native gate that suppresses the card when the device role is internal/external, so a native trigger (push/directive) can't bypass the C# post-login guard. Sends the cancel callback so any caller cleans up.

## [0.8.37] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- sdk: cross-lane parity batch (report tunnel gating, SSO button gating, iOS crash video).
- - #55 report tunnel is now role-gated on all lanes: opens only for internal/external testers (and debug/internal builds); public users are HTTP-poll-only (no persistent WS), matching the documented Communication Architecture. Android re-adds the gate it dropped in N7 (with clean close on tester?public downgrade); iOS adds external to the internal-only check; C# upgrades on internal OR external and bundles useNativeTunnel for debug/internal builds.
- - #56 SSO buttons are gated on configuration AND the open profile picker live-refreshes when the poll merges SSO config � so a configured provider's button appears after the first poll without reopening (fixes the local-first pre-poll auto-prompt hiding it). Google gated on both lanes; Apple gated on Android (web flow), always-shown on iOS (native ASAuthorization). C# picker has no SSO buttons (n/a).
- - #54 iOS crashes/ANRs now carry video, mirroring Android: BugpunchRingRecorder writes VideoToolbox samples to an mmap'd on-disk ring (byte-for-byte Android's bp_video format) that survives process death; the crash handler records the ring path async-signal-safely (msync + raw write, no Obj-C/malloc); the crash drain adds a deferred video_ring attachment; BugpunchUploader gains the deferred-attachment / lazy-produce path that remuxes the ring to mp4 (new BugpunchVideoRingRemuxer) only when the server's collect[] wants video, else attaches a diagnostic text part.

## [0.8.36] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix login + SSO + analytics + push parity with Android (mirror audit).
- - Login/SSO: poller now extracts projectId and merges gameConfig.sso from the bootstrap (BugpunchRuntime.setProjectId / mergeServerSsoConfig) � fixes "Bugpunch isn't fully started" on email/password login and dead Google/Apple SSO buttons (config was never populated on iOS).
- - SSO post: stop double-firing OnProfilePicked / double-persisting identity (helper no longer hydrates � the picker is the sole apply path, mirroring Android); device token is now an optional hint instead of a hard requirement (fixes SSO failing in the first seconds after launch); accept any 2xx, not only 200.
- - Identity validator: lenient `valid` coercion (mirror Android optBoolean).
- - Analytics: auto-start the session lifecycle from StartDebugMode (iOS was emitting zero session_start/session_end unless the game called a tracking API � no DAU/retention); fix events shipping empty deviceId/scene/buildVersion (read from metadata, not config); rotate the session id on 30s+ resume.
- - Push: register the canonical user id from Bugpunch_SetUserId (was null when set via SetUserId, so server couldn't target pushes at logged-in users); added Bugpunch_CurrentUserId C accessor.
- - Uploader: send an explicit User-Agent (Cloudflare/carrier hardening, mirror Android).
- sdk(ios,android): keep SSO buttons unconditional on both lanes (gate-on-config needs a live picker refresh under local-first boot � tracked as bugpunch-sdk#56).

## [0.8.35] - 2026-05-30

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix push notification link failure � Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId was declared `extern` (C++-mangled) in BugpunchPush.mm but BugpunchTunnel defines it `extern "C"`, so v0.8.34 failed to link into game builds (Undefined symbols for arm64: Bugpunch_TunnelDeviceId, referenced from BPPushDeviceId). Now declared `extern "C"` to match.
- sdk(csharp): bundle in-flight changes � BugpunchLogHandler, ContextObjectCapture, crash handler + debug mode edits.

## [0.8.34] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): native push notifications (server#308). FCM on Android (BugpunchMessagingService + BugpunchPush: notification channel, permission, tap intents) and APNs on iOS (UIApplicationDelegate swizzling for device-token capture, UNUserNotificationCenter for receive + tap). Push token is registered to the server from shared BugpunchRuntime state. Mobile-only, no Editor/Standalone lane. Manifest + Gradle wiring added.
- sdk(android,ios): credential sign-in + profile-picker rework (BugpunchCredentialSignIn, BugpunchProfilePicker) with BugpunchPoller + BugpunchRuntime updates and an iOS post-process build step.
- sdk(scripting): security hardening of the embedded ODDGames.Scripting VM (the on-device QA/diagnostic script sandbox, compiled into the runtime). Enforce a hard BCL deny-list at VM dispatch (System.IO, System.Diagnostics, System.Net, System.Reflection, System.Runtime.InteropServices, System.Threading except Tasks, System.Security, plus System.Type/Activator/AppDomain/Environment/Delegate) so untrusted scripts can no longer reach file, process, network, or reflection APIs. Close the reflection-walk escape: any Type-derived declaring type is blocked, so a GetType().Assembly.GetType(...) chain cannot re-introduce a denied type. Add execution resource limits (instruction budget, call-depth cap, eval-stack growth cap) preventing a runaway script (infinite loop, unbounded recursion, string-doubling) from pegging the CPU, overflowing the stack, or OOMing the game process (main-thread ANR).

## [0.8.33] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix launch hang / boot loop on the +load path � BugpunchTouch_Start read UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds/scale synchronously on the main thread, but Bugpunch_StartDebugMode runs from the +load bootstrap (before UIApplicationMain). Touching UIScreen before the app has connected to the window server blocks the main thread forever waiting on a frontboard connection that isn't up yet, so the iOS launch watchdog killed the app as a stuck process � a repeating boot loop. The sendEvent: swizzle stays synchronous (pure objc-runtime, safe at +load); the UIScreen capture-size seed is now deferred via dispatch_async to the main queue (RecordTouches refreshes the size on every touch anyway). Found via the [BP-BOOT] launch instrumentation from 0.8.32, which stays in for one confirming run and gets stripped next release.

## [0.8.32] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- sdk: v0.8.31
- ?sdk: v0.8.30 - sdk(csharp): goals are now text-as-key � the first string is both the goal key AND the dashboard label; the separate snake-case id arg is gone (goals are per-build, so rewording between builds is fine). The declare and observe forms collapse into one Goal(text, value[, () => eval]) call, and a new no-enum multi-step overload Goal(text, string[] steps, () => currentStep) reports progress as currentStep/steps.Length � including goals that only complete across an app restart (a step that can't be observed until a later launch, e.g. "earned coins survive a relaunch"). The enum-anchored multi-step form is removed. The build-time Cecil scanner was reworked to extract text-as-key goals and inline string[] step arrays, and now correctly skips capturing, cached non-capturing, and async evaluator lambdas; dynamic-id emits are skipped silently instead of failing the build.
- ?sdk: v0.8.29 - sdk(android,ios): auto-start MediaProjection recording on tester-role resolution. startAutoRecording now fires from the single role-resolution path (login, server push, launch auto-prompt) the moment a player lands on a tester tier (internal/external); idempotent, still gated behind the OS MediaProjection consent dialog, torn down on return to public.

- ?sdk: v0.8.18 - sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion � enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- ?sdk: v0.8.17 - sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked � there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.
- ?sdk: v0.8.16 - sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check � #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- ?sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched � mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- ?sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 � BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there.

The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path � its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- ?sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter � replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 � 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- ?sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error � migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit � new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- ?sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled � EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- ?sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching � BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig � they now live in the dashboard (Settings ? SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` ? `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId � the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim � per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup

## [0.8.30] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- sdk(csharp): goals are now text-as-key � the first string is both the goal key AND the dashboard label; the separate snake-case id arg is gone (goals are per-build, so rewording between builds is fine). The declare and observe forms collapse into one Goal(text, value[, () => eval]) call, and a new no-enum multi-step overload Goal(text, string[] steps, () => currentStep) reports progress as currentStep/steps.Length � including goals that only complete across an app restart (a step that can't be observed until a later launch, e.g. "earned coins survive a relaunch"). The enum-anchored multi-step form is removed. The build-time Cecil scanner was reworked to extract text-as-key goals and inline string[] step arrays, and now correctly skips capturing, cached non-capturing, and async evaluator lambdas; dynamic-id emits are skipped silently instead of failing the build.
- sdk(android): audio capture for WebRTC streaming � new BugpunchAudioCapture + BugpunchWebrtcAudioInjector, with bp_video / BugpunchStreamer / BugpunchRecorder / AndroidManifest updates.
- sdk(ios): BugpunchChatViewController / BugpunchCrashHandler / BugpunchDebugMode updates.
- sdk(csharp): feedback board HTTP updates.

## [0.8.29] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): auto-start MediaProjection recording on tester-role resolution. startAutoRecording now fires from the single role-resolution path (login, server push, launch auto-prompt) the moment a player lands on a tester tier (internal/external); idempotent, still gated behind the OS MediaProjection consent dialog, torn down on return to public.
- sdk(android): chat board drops the bot-style name/email onboarding. Identity is sourced from the signed-in SSO player (login required before debug mode), removing ~314 lines of onboarding/identity-prefs code.
- sdk(editor): config inspector surfaces the Google Play foreground-service declaration. Copyable justification text, Play Console link, and demo-video note so integrators complete it before a production submission.

## [0.8.28] - 2026-05-28

- ?sdk: v0.8.21
- ?sdk: v0.8.20
- sdk(editor): fix CS0029 � AssemblyReloadCallback isn't Action; make TryUnhookStatic generic
- sdk(editor): also unhook Unity.WebRTC's after-assembly-reload handler
- ?sdk: v0.8.19
- sdk: preprocessor warn-not-fail + retries; build-all.ps1 reuses iOS CI when src unchanged
- ?sdk: v0.8.18 - sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion � enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- ?sdk: v0.8.17 - sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked � there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.
- ?sdk: v0.8.16 - sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check � #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- ?sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched � mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- ?sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 � BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there.

BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path G�� its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- n++sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter G�� replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 +� 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- n++sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error G�� migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit G�� new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- n++sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled G�� EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- n++sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching G�� BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig G�� they now live in the dashboard (Settings G�� SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` G�� `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId G�� the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim G�� per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce G�� Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup

- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.21
- n++sdk: v0.8.20
- sdk(editor): fix CS0029 G�� AssemblyReloadCallback isn't Action; make TryUnhookStatic generic
- sdk(editor): also unhook Unity.WebRTC's after-assembly-reload handler
- n++sdk: v0.8.19
- sdk: preprocessor warn-not-fail + retries; build-all.ps1 reuses iOS CI when src unchanged
- n++sdk: v0.8.18 - sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion G�� enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- n++sdk: v0.8.17 - sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked G�� there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.
- n++sdk: v0.8.16 - sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check G�� #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- n++sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched G�� mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- n++sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 G�� BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there. The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim.

Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig � they now live in the dashboard (Settings ? SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` ? `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId � the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim � per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- ?sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup

## [0.8.22] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.21
- n++sdk: v0.8.20
- sdk(editor): fix CS0029 G�� AssemblyReloadCallback isn't Action; make TryUnhookStatic generic
- sdk(editor): also unhook Unity.WebRTC's after-assembly-reload handler
- n++sdk: v0.8.19
- sdk: preprocessor warn-not-fail + retries; build-all.ps1 reuses iOS CI when src unchanged
- n++sdk: v0.8.18 - sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion G�� enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- n++sdk: v0.8.17 - sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked G�� there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.
- n++sdk: v0.8.16 - sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check G�� #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- n++sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched G�� mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- n++sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 G�� BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there. The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim. The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path G�� its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- n++sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter G�� replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 +� 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- n++sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error G�� migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit G�� new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- n++sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled G�� EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- n++sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching G�� BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig G�� they now live in the dashboard (Settings G�� SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK

In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check G�� #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- n++sdk: v0.8.15 - sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched G�� mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- n++sdk: v0.8.14 - sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 G�� BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there. The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim. The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path G�� its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- n++sdk: v0.8.13 - sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter G�� replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 +� 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- n++sdk: v0.8.12 - sdk(ios): fix archive link error G�� migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.11 - sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit G�� new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- n++sdk: v0.8.10 - sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled G�� EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- n++sdk: v0.8.9 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching G�� BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig G�� they now live in the dashboard (Settings G�� SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.8 - sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` G�� `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId G�� the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim G�� per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- n++sdk: v0.8.7 - sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce G�� Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk: v0.8.5 - sdk(android,ios): pause tunnel on app background, resume on foreground
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI

## [0.8.18] - 2026-05-26

### Changed
- sdk(csharp,inspector): massive Remote IDE inspector expansion � enum dropdowns + Flags popovers, LayerMask / SortingLayer / Tag pickers, generic UnityEngine.Object picker for any ref field, AnimationCurve / Gradient editors, UnityEvent listener inspection (read-only), Array/List with drag-to-reorder, SerializeReference polymorphic picker, math expressions in number inputs (10*2, 90*pi/180), [Range]/[Tooltip]/[Header]/[Space]/[TextArea]/[Multiline]/[InspectorName]/[Min] attribute reading, drag-from-Hierarchy onto ref slots (auto GetComponent for Transform fields). Material editor gains shader swap, reset to defaults, copy-from-other, per-property texture upload. Object picker gains generic asset upload (Texture/Sprite/AudioClip(WAV)/Mesh(OBJ)). Add/Remove components on a GameObject. All option lists lazy-fetched on first popover open, cached per-(device,type).
- sdk(editor): three new build-time exporters bake editor-only data into Resources files shipped with the game � BugpunchTags.json (authoritative TagManager list), BugpunchAssetIndex.json (every Resources/ asset with path+type+guid), BugpunchPropertyDrawers.json (user-defined [CustomPropertyDrawer] map). Runtime SDK loads these for tag autocomplete, the new Assets browser, and PropertyDrawer hints. Menu items + pre-build hooks under ODD Games / Bugpunch.

## [0.8.17] - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- sdk(csharp): consent now persists for the Editor process lifetime. The v0.8.15 design reset BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted on every tunnel reconnect ("per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept"), which sounded right but in practice re-prompted on every brief network blip / server restart / Alt-Tab cycle. Removed the resets in BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs OnConnected + OnDisconnected so a once-accepted Editor IDE session stays open across reconnects. Brings the C# lane in line with how Android + iOS already worked � there, the act of entering debug mode IS the consent grant and survives WS reconnects. New process = fresh consent on all three lanes.

## [0.8.16] - 2026-05-25

### Changed
- sdk(csharp): fix Editor focus-disconnect that killed just-accepted IDE sessions. OnApplicationFocusChanged was forcing a disconnect on every focus regain (rationale: refresh stale state after mobile background). In the Editor, clicking between Unity and the browser fires that hook every time, dropping the IDE session within ~1.5s of accepting it. Now skips the disconnect in Editor mode via Application.isEditor (runtime check � #if UNITY_EDITOR doesn't apply to the Standalone-built DLL when Unity loads it in Editor). Mobile/Standalone behavior unchanged.
- sdk(csharp): IdeTunnel OnError no longer escalates transient WS lifecycle events (peer-closed, unreachable server during reconnect) through BugpunchNative.ReportSdkError. Those are normal during server restarts / offline windows and were spamming the dashboard's SDK-error panel. IdeTunnel already logs them with backoff context. External OnError subscribers still receive the event.
- sdk(editor): F12 reporter title/description tweaks � user's typed description now leads the report body (so the issue detail header subtitle reads their words instead of "F12 quick capture from Unity Editor Play Mode" boilerplate). Title falls back to empty string when the user didn't pin an exception, letting the server's LLM title helper summarise instead of the low-signal "Unity Editor F12 capture: <scene> HH:mm:ss" template.
- sdk(editor): EditorVideoRingNative.Start() availability-guard tightened.

## [0.8.15] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- sdk(editor): incoming-connection consent prompt for the Remote IDE. When Bugpunch is enabled in the Editor the report-tunnel WS opens immediately (logs / heartbeat / crash uploads stream as before) but interactive IDE RPC is now gated per-tunnel-session. The dashboard clicking Open Remote IDE makes the server push a new connectRequest frame on the editor's open WS; the editor pops a UIToolkit EditorWindow (BugpunchEditorDebugConsentWindow) with reason / urgency / requester / Accept / Decline. The decision ships back as a connectDecision frame, routes through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder, and sets BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted true on accept. RemoteIDE.RequestRouter refuses every IDE RPC with 403 consent_required until that flag is set. Closing the window without choosing counts as Decline. Consent resets on every tunnel reconnect (per-WS-session grant, no stale Accept). Non-editor lanes are untouched � mobile keeps the poll-based promptOnDevice + native consent dialog path.
- sdk(csharp,runtime): supporting plumbing. New IdeTunnel.OnConnectRequest event + SendConnectDecision helper; connectRequest case in HandleMessage. BugpunchRuntime.IdeConsentGranted shared state (mirror rule: RequestRouter reads runtime state, never the client). BugpunchClient.HandleIdeConnectRequest branches on lane � registers an editor-only UIToolkit handler via BugpunchClient.EditorConsentHandler bridge slot ([InitializeOnLoad] BugpunchEditorConsentBridge installs it without the runtime taking a hard ref to the Editor assembly), falls back to BugpunchNative.PresentDebugConsent on Standalone managed lane. OnDebugConsentResult extended to ship the WS decision when a connectRequest is pending.
- server: project-scope auth check on POST /api/devices/:id/request-debug. Previously any authenticated user could queue a debug request against any device (only requireAuth was applied). Now resolves the device's project_id via pinService.findByDeviceRef and 403s callers outside the project (admins still pass). reportTunnelService gains sendConnectRequest(deviceId, requestId, reason, urgency, requestedBy) that pushes the frame only when the connected platform string ends with Editor (WindowsEditor / OSXEditor / LinuxEditor); inbound connectDecision frames route through the existing reportDebugRequestDecision recorder. deviceService.requestDebugSession lazy-imports sendConnectRequest so editors with an open WS get the prompt within ~1 frame instead of waiting for the slower poll cycle to pick up upgradeToWebSocket � mobile lanes continue to use the existing poll-based path.

## [0.8.14] - 2026-05-22

### Changed
- sdk(editor): fix TypeLoadException on Unity 6.0 � BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle hard-referenced UnityEditor.Toolbars.MainToolbarButton / MainToolbarElement / MainToolbarContent at IL level, which failed to resolve on Unity 6000.0.x because the types live in a different assembly there. The cascade tripped Assembly.GetTypes() on the whole Bugpunch.Editor DLL the moment Fusion OrderSorter reflected over it, and every nested compiler-generated state machine in the DLL (BugpunchSymbolUploader.KickOffInteractive, EditorVideoRing.SnapshotForPreview / SnapshotForUpload, etc) was reported as a red-herring TypeLoadException victim. The modern attribute-based toolbar registration is removed; BugpunchEnableToolbarToggle is now a tiny [InitializeOnLoadMethod] that primes the EditorPref default. BugpunchLegacyToolbarToggle's reflection-based IMGUI pill is now the only toolbar path � its version gate widened from less-than-6.1 to less-than-6.3 so 6.1 and 6.2 also get a visible pill; 6.3+ users access the toggle via the Bugpunch menu (Unity hides reflection-injected toolbar children there under "Unsupported User Elements").
- sdk(editor): F12 reporter redesigned in UXML + USS � visual structure moved to Editor/UI/BugpunchEditorQuickTaskDialog.uxml, all styling (pill tabs, hover/active pseudo-classes, transitions, preview letterbox, button states) into Editor/UI/BugpunchEditorQuickTaskDialog.uss. BugpunchEditorQuickTaskDialog.cs collapsed from ~800 lines of inline IStyle to ~540-line controller � loads UXML via AssetDatabase, binds elements by name query, toggles state via class lists. Hot-reload USS to iterate on look without recompiling the editor DLL.
- sdk(editor): F12 gets an Exceptions tab � recent unhandled exceptions and errors (already buffered by BugpunchEditorQuickTaskHotkey.OnLog) now surface as a clickable list. Click an item to attach its stack trace to the report; click again to deselect. Nothing is auto-selected, ever. Tab only appears when there are exceptions to pick. Data tab gains an Exception row that mirrors the current selection.
- sdk(csharp): fix double-ReceiveAsync race in IdeTunnel � RunReconnectLoop used Task.WhenAny over ReceiveLoop and HeartbeatLoop which returned when either task finished but did not cancel the other; the surviving loop then re-read the _ws instance field on its next iteration, so when the next reconnect cycle replaced _ws with a fresh socket the stale loop called ReceiveAsync on it concurrently with the new loop. Now both loops take ClientWebSocket and CancellationToken as parameters bound to THIS connection, and after WhenAny the live cts is cancelled and both tasks drained via WhenAll before the iteration ends.

## [0.8.13] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- sdk(editor,windows): in-memory video ring for F12 reporter � replaces the 90-second segment-rotation hack that wrote mp4 chunks to disk and spammed "[Recorder] Recording saved" on every rotation. ODDRecorder.dll now runs the H.264 MFT encoder MFT continuously, stores encoded NAL packets in a keyframe-aware std::deque, and mux-passes them through a fresh sink writer only when F12 fires. RAM-resident (~50 MB at 720p60 � 90s), no disk activity until dump, forced IDR every ~2s so any trim stays decodable.
- sdk(editor): new EditorVideoRingNative bridge � P/Invoke + render-event Driver coroutine sits between the native ring and the F12 quick-task runner. BugpunchEditorQuickTaskRunner.EditorVideoRing collapses to a thin wrapper (no Rotate(), no StartNewSegment(), no WaitForFile(), Tick() is a no-op).
- sdk(editor): F12 dialog polish � pill tabs taller (28 to 34) with bigger padding (14 to 20) and clearer active/inactive contrast. Screenshot + video previews now center inside their host via flex alignment + absolute-positioned Image, so ScaleToFit letterboxes within the full preview area instead of pinning to a corner.
- sdk(editor): BugpunchEditorToggle thread-safe IsEnabled � background callers (Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded ? OnLog) can now hit IsEnabled without throwing UnityException. Main thread re-reads EditorPrefs and updates a volatile cache; background threads serve the cache.
- sdk(editor): toolbar pill simplified � main-toolbar Bugpunch button drops the bundled pill+wordmark PNG (Unity crushed it to a square on the toolbar) and uses a rich-text "? Bugpunch" label whose dot is orange when on / gray when off.
- sdk(windows): build-odd-recorder.bat � replaces build-odd-recorder.ps1 for native DLL builds. The ps1 used a cmd /c multi-line string pattern that silently dropped every line after `call vsDevCmd`, so the script reported success without invoking cl. New batch file actually runs the compile and exits with cl's real status code.

## [0.8.12] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix archive link error � migrate the three remaining call sites of the retired Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen (Bugpunch_EnterDebugMode, Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard, Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard in BugpunchDebugMode.mm + BugpunchReportOverlay.mm) to Bugpunch_ShowProfilePickerForAutoPrompt, matching the Android-side migration done in v0.8.9 when the legacy email-entry flow was removed. Without this iOS archives failed with "Undefined symbols: _Bugpunch_EnsurePublicAuthThen".

## [0.8.11] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(editor): F12 reporter now requires a Bugpunch login before submit � new BugpunchEditorAuth module pops a UIToolkit email + password modal on the first F12 of a session, POSTs to /api/auth/login, and caches {token, email, displayName, userId, orgId} to EditorPrefs so subsequent Editor sessions skip the modal. CaptureAndUpload sends Authorization: Bearer <jwt> alongside the existing X-API-Key so the server can attach the report to the signed-in user. HTTP 401 from the ingest endpoint clears the cached token automatically so the next F12 re-prompts instead of failing silently.
- sdk(editor): Ambient log capture + video ring buffer are now gated on the Bugpunch toolbar toggle � Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded buffers logs only when the toggle is ON, and BugpunchEditorQuickTaskRunner subscribes to BugpunchEditorToggle.Changed to start/stop EditorVideoRing in lockstep. Matches the mobile model where ambient capture only runs once the player has entered debug mode. Toggle OFF ? no GPU/memory cost from the ring and F12 carries no log tail; toggle ON ? everything functions as if the Editor session were an internal tester device.

## [0.8.10] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(editor): Editor SDK now defaults to enabled � EditorPrefs default flipped to true and a one-shot InitializeOnLoadMethod writes the pref explicitly on first launch so the Editor shows up as a device and streams logs out of the box.
- sdk(editor): BUGPUNCH toolbar button next to Play / Pause / Step on Unity 6.1+ via the official `[MainToolbarElement]` API � switched from MainToolbarToggle to MainToolbarButton so there's no gray "checked" highlight around the icon when on. Custom pill + Bug/punch wordmark PNGs (orange when on, gray when off) ride inside the icon, `element.displayed = true` so it auto-appears in the toolbar, and `MainToolbar.Refresh` is called after the click so the icon visibly flips state.
- sdk(editor): Unity 6.0 keeps a reflection-based fallback (IMGUIContainer in ToolbarZoneRightAlign � same pattern as the unity-toolbar-extender package) since the official MainToolbar API only exists on 6.1+. Uses GUIStyle.none button with the same wordmark icons so the 6.0 path visually matches the 6.1+ button (no toggle highlight either). Runtime-gated by Application.unityVersion so exactly one path fires per editor version.

## [0.8.9] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios,csharp): remove the legacy email-entry login flow and PlayerPrefs-based auth caching � BugpunchEmailEntry (Java + Obj-C++) and BugpunchManagedLoginDialog (C#) are deleted, ShowEmailEntry/ShowEmailEntryIfNeeded/SetPlayerAuthSession/SetPlayerEmail/RestorePlayerAuth removed from the Bugpunch facade, and OnEmailEntrySignedIn dropped from BugpunchClient. Tester identity now comes solely from the SSO profile picker (Google / Apple); native owns persistence and pushes the identity back into Unity via OnProfilePicked / OnProfileSignedOut which mirror directly into BugpunchRuntime. Per-project OAuth client ids (googleClientIdIos, googleWebClientId, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri) and the playerLogin sprite/title/subtitle fields are removed from BugpunchConfig � they now live in the dashboard (Settings ? SDK SSO) and are pushed to native at runtime via BugpunchRuntime.mergeServerSsoConfig, so rotating a client id no longer requires a fresh APK

## [0.8.8] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(android,csharp): rename `googleClientIdAndroid` ? `googleWebClientId` to match what AndroidX Credential Manager actually wants in setServerClientId � the OAuth Web client ID, not the Android one. Tooltip rewritten to spell out why (Android-type client still required separately for Cloud Console to authorize the APK's package+SHA-1, but its value is not what the SDK sends). Java's friendlyError now surfaces a hint when Google replies "Developer console is not set up correctly" so the next dev hitting this knows where to look. Server + dashboard rename ships separately via /deploy-server. No migration shim � per pre-release, re-paste the Web client ID into BugpunchConfig.googleWebClientId and the dashboard SDK SSO card after upgrade
- sdk(android,ios,csharp): default accentBug recoloured from dark red (#943838) to the Bugpunch logo orange (#EA7A2C). Bug-report surfaces now match the brand instead of clashing with it
- sdk(android,ios): Bug Punch wordmark on the report card gets a fixed height + 10dp bottom margin so the description textarea lines up with the preview container's top edge � was previously off by a few pixels

## [0.8.7] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios,csharp): diagnostic mode bypasses exception cooldown/debounce � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode now flows from C# to native via "diagnostic":true in extraJson and bypasses both the C# IsDuplicateReport check and the native autoReportCooldownSeconds gate so QA/dev tooling receives every event. C# debounce signature also tightened from (title + first 200 chars of stack) to (title + full stack) for exact-match dedup
- sdk(android): bundle Credential Manager + googleid + browser as bugpunch_sso.androidlib � Unity doesn't resolve AAR POM transitives, so BugpunchPlugin.aar's compile-time deps for AndroidX Credential Manager, the googleid library, and androidx.browser CustomTabs weren't reaching the consumer APK. Google sign-in caught a NoClassDefFoundError and showed "Google sign-in unavailable"; Apple sign-in's unguarded `new CustomTabsIntent.Builder()` threw the same on the UI thread and crashed the app. The new .androidlib stub puts the four implementation deps on the consumer's runtime classpath without an AAR rebuild

## [0.8.6] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(ios): add missing extern "C" to the BugpunchProfilePicker call site for Bugpunch_ShowEmailEntry � without it the Obj-C++ caller name-mangled the symbol while the C definition in BugpunchEmailEntry.mm didn't, so iOS archives failed to link

## [0.8.5] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): pause tunnel on app background, resume on foreground � backgrounded phones were staying "online + seconds ago" on the Devices page because the WS library kept the socket warm in a suspended process; now we tear down on background and reconnect on foreground so the server's idle sweep flips us to offline
- sdk(android,ios): drop pre-filled "Shake report"/"Bug report" titles from shake + debug-widget triggers so users see an empty form

## [0.8.4] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- sdk: diagnostic mode � Bugpunch.SetDiagnosticMode(bool) toggles a per-process flag that injects `diagnostic:true` into the upload payload. Server bypasses both per-diversity and overall sample caps without consuming budget slots, so QA/dev runs from debug tools don't crowd out real user crashes. Events tagged `is_diagnostic`, parent issue gets sticky `has_diagnostic_events` flag.
- sdk(editor): source upload now includes Packages/ and Library/PackageCache/ entries (rewritten to virtual `Packages/<name>/...` paths matching Unity's stack-trace format) so dashboard source previews resolve frames inside UPM packages, not just project Assets/.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): capture first 500 KB of session logs into a frozen buffer at startup so bug reports always carry boot-time context
- sdk(android,ios): bug-report logs payload composes first 500 KB + last 500 KB of the live ring with a "skipped N bytes" separator (1 MB combined, 1.5 MB total memory ceiling including native ring); streams straight to gzip with no full-payload String alloc
- sdk(android,ios): report form right column gains a "Bug Punch" wordmark; Data tab now surfaces Attachments / Reporter (role/email/name/id/provider) / Device (model/OS/platform/GPU/deviceId) / App (version/bundle/buildCode/fingerprint/Unity/branch/changeset/scene/fps/installer) / Context (tags count, SystemInfo property count, extra accounts, severity, type)
- sdk(ios): expose Bugpunch_TunnelCurrentTesterRole C accessor so the report form can render the current role on the Data tab
- sdk(csharp): per-signature exception debounce in BugpunchCrashHandler � caps JNI/P-Invoke crossings during a tight exception loop while still letting distinct exceptions through; native cooldown remains the second layer

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- sdk(android,ios): redesign bug report form with two-column tabbed layout � left side has Screenshot/Video/Image N/Data tabs with video playback (play/pause + scrubber + mm:ss time); right side has placeholder-only textarea + Cancel/Send buttons
- sdk(android,ios): dump ring buffer on report form open so video can be previewed and scrubbed before send; prepared MP4 reused at submit (no double-dump)
- sdk(android,ios): add Data tab summarizing what gets sent � attachments (screenshot/annotations/video/extras/logs size), identity (email/name/player id), device (model/OS)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Re-add BugpunchWebRTCQuitGuard editor helper (was dropped between v0.7.18 and v0.8.0). [InitializeOnLoad] unhooks Unity.WebRTC ContextManager.Quit from EditorApplication.quitting so batch-mode CI builds no longer log the EntryPointNotFoundException: RegisterDebugLog trace at editor exit when libwebrtc wasn't loaded.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- - **Apple Sign in with Apple on Android.** Full end-to-end round-trip � previously stubbed. SDK now POSTs the OAuth `state` to a new prepare endpoint, launches Apple's authorize URL with `response_type=code id_token` + `response_mode=form_post`, server validates state and 302s to `bugpunch://apple-callback?state=�&idToken=�`. New `AppleCallbackActivity` catches the deep link via `<intent-filter>` and forwards into `BugpunchAppleSignIn.onIdTokenReceived`. No client_secret JWT, no Apple p8 key needed.
- - **Per-project SDK SSO config.** Google Android / iOS client IDs, Apple bundle ID, Apple Services ID, and Apple return URL now live on each project's settings (Project Settings ? SDK SSO) instead of server env vars. `BugpunchPoller` hoists `gameConfig.sso` into the top-level runtime config so the existing sign-in readers see them. Server's `sdkSsoSignInService` reads project-scoped values; env-var fallback retained for migration.
- - Profile picker / email entry / report form / tunnel polish across Android + iOS lanes.
- - Feedback board attachment + styling + submit-view refinements (C#).

## [0.7.19] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk: v0.7.18 - Silence Unity.WebRTC EntryPointNotFoundException at Editor exit G�� added BugpunchWebRTCQuitGuard (editor-only) that unhooks Unity.WebRTC ContextManager.Quit from EditorApplication.quitting. The native libwebrtc plugin isn't always loaded in batch-mode CI iOS builds (no debug session = no WebRTC use), so the unconditional RegisterDebugLog cleanup call inside DisposeInternal threw on Editor shutdown G�� build exit code was already 0 but the trace made CI logs look like a failure.
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI

## [0.7.18] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Silence Unity.WebRTC EntryPointNotFoundException at Editor exit � added BugpunchWebRTCQuitGuard (editor-only) that unhooks Unity.WebRTC ContextManager.Quit from EditorApplication.quitting. The native libwebrtc plugin isn't always loaded in batch-mode CI iOS builds (no debug session = no WebRTC use), so the unconditional RegisterDebugLog cleanup call inside DisposeInternal threw on Editor shutdown � build exit code was already 0 but the trace made CI logs look like a failure.

## [0.7.17] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Report form redesign � three numbered fields (Describe the problem / Steps to reproduce / Additional details), with the screenshot/video tab toggle dropped. When video footage is available it now wins the media panel slot; thumbnail strip still hangs below for extra shots. iOS removes keyboard-inset scroll handling in favor of the new flat layout. Severity field gone (hardcoded to medium server-side).

## [0.7.16] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- DebugAutoPrompt � launch flow also fires when a persisted identity exists, not only when the server-cached role is internal/external. Once a tester signs in once, every subsequent launch shows the picker (lets them switch) and auto-enters debug mode the moment the picker dismisses.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- ReportActivity cleanup � drops the profile avatar + Bugpunch wordmark from the header (back arrow only), removes the email + severity fields (email pulled from signed-in identity, severity hardcoded to medium), and goes full-screen with edge-to-edge system bar styling.
- DebugMode.enter � skips the in-app consent dialog and goes straight to the OS-level MediaProjection prompt; that system dialog remains the only consent step.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Fix BugpunchDebugMode.enter � wraps body in activity.runOnUiThread so JNI callers from worker threads no longer throw the Looper.prepare error when the profile picker / consent dialog gets shown.
- Fix BugpunchNative.ReportSdkError C# log label � was logging the literal placeholder instead of the source string.

## [0.7.13] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Fix BugpunchDebugMode.enter � wraps body in activity.runOnUiThread so JNI callers from worker threads (BugpunchRequestHelpPicker ? BugpunchNative.EnterDebugMode ? JNI from Thread-3) no longer throw "Can't create handler inside thread that has not called Looper.prepare()" when the profile picker / consent dialog gets shown.
- Fix BugpunchNative.ReportSdkError C# log label � was logging the literal "{src}" instead of the source string.

## [0.7.12] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- SDK Bugs tab � Send to Bugpunch button in the SdkErrorOverlay now mirrors every ring entry to /api/sdk-error in addition to the per-project reportBug path, so admin Settings receives the report even when the host game's API key is empty or the customer's project ingest fails. BugpunchRuntime.postSdkErrorAsync is now package-private so the overlay can invoke it directly.
- EmailEntry � drops the prefill on both Android + iOS so a persisted identity that carries a provider token instead of a real email never lands in the input field; user must type a clean email every time.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- SDK self-diagnostic errors POST to the server's new public /api/sdk-error sink � Android BugpunchRuntime.reportSdkError and iOS Bugpunch_ReportSdkError both fire-and-forget alongside the in-app banner. Lands in admin Settings ? SDK Bugs.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Gravatar fallback wired end-to-end � SDK picker tile + dashboard ReporterBadge both fall back to Gravatar when no provider avatar URL is set. Server identityFor + profilesTop responses also fill avatarUrl from MD5-of-lowercased-email when no avatarKey is uploaded.
- Picker profile circles grouped + centred (not weight-distributed) with a 10dp gap between each.
- d=404 on every Gravatar URL so unregistered emails surface 404 and the tile falls through to the initials chip instead of caching a grey silhouette.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Profile picker � horizontal row of avatar circles + plus tile distributed by weight, small subtitle restored above the row.
- Long-press a profile circle to remove it from local history � AlertDialog confirm; if the removed profile is the active identity it gets signed out at the same time.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Profile picker � horizontal row of avatar circles + "+" tile distributed by weight, small subtitle "Choose a profile to continue, or tap + to add another." restored above the row.
- Long-press a profile circle to remove it from local history � AlertDialog confirm; if the removed profile is the active identity it gets signed out at the same time.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Profile circles now show a small provider badge bottom-right � Google G / Apple / Bugpunch logo so users can tell at a glance which SSO each profile belongs to.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Profile picker converted back to circular tiles � avatar (Google/Apple picture URL ? Gravatar fallback computed from the email's MD5 ? initials chip) above a single-line display label, "+" tile follows the same circle shape. Drops the row layout that was leaking the long auth-provider token next to the email.
- Drops "Choose a profile" title + subtitle from the picker � wordmark and circles speak for themselves.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Request-help picker drops the title and subtitle so all 3 option rows fit on landscape phones.
- Profile tile elements 30% smaller � avatar 52?36, name 17?13, email 14?11, row min-height 86?60 � and the displayed name falls back to the email's local part when the backend handed us a long auth-provider token instead of a real name.
- EmailEntry login button is the brand orange + 15% tighter � wordmark 28?24, button height 52?44, field heights 48?41, font 16?14, padding tightened across the column.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- "Punch" half of the wordmark now uses the brand orange BugpunchPretty.BRAND_ACCENT / BPBrandAccent() � hardcoded so a project-customised accentRecord can't tint the wordmark red.
- Request-help picker drops the wordmark � 3 options fit on landscape phones without scrolling.
- Profile-select screen tightened � wordmark 24sp, screen title 18sp, subtitle 13sp, less inter-block padding so the picker fits on smaller cards.
- Welcome card logo halved (44dp ? 22dp on Android, 44pt ? 22pt on iOS) per the new visual weight.
- EmailEntry adds a Password field for Bugpunch internal sign-in (UI only at this pass � back-end auth wiring still TODO).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- DebugMode.enter short-circuits the profile picker when an identity is already known � cold-install users still see the SSO buttons before recording starts, but existing users go straight to consent.
- Welcome card, request-help card and managed-lane login + request-help dialogs picked up the elevated card style + two-tone Bugpunch wordmark used by the picker.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Picker shows the profile tiles + "+" state on first launch after upgrade � if there's a persisted current identity but no auth_history_json yet, migrate the current blob into a single-entry history so the picker can render tiles + "+" instead of the bare SSO row.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Profile picker is now the only login gate � DebugMode + chat + feedback all route through BugpunchProfilePicker.showForAutoPrompt, not BugpunchEmailEntry.ensurePublicAuthThen. EmailEntry is reachable only via the picker's Bugpunch button.
- Dropped the green-tinted logo halo on the legacy EmailEntry sheet � both lanes now show the two-tone "Bugpunch" wordmark used by the picker.
- Removed scroll views from picker + request-help + welcome overlays � cards size to content; tile rows distribute by weight so up to 5 profiles + "+" share card width without scrolling.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Profile picker redesign � two-tone Bugpunch wordmark, warning callout with glowing icon, official Google G logo + ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton (iOS) / Apple vector drawable (Android), Bugpunch button hosts email entry
- Local-first profile history � up to 5 identities cached on-device (Keychain on iOS, SharedPreferences + Auto Backup rules on Android, PlayerPrefs on managed); no /profiles/top or /profiles/select roundtrip so debug mode can boot pre-network
- Request-help panel redesign � How can we help? + vertical option rows with circle-wrapped icons, mockup-aligned labels (Ask A Question / Record A Bug / Request A Feature)
- Card style unification � BugpunchPretty.cardBackground helper, 24dp radius, heavy black drop shadow, 1px white inner highlight; applied across picker, EmailEntry, DebugConsentDialog, DebugMode welcome, ToolsOverlay/Panel, ReportOverlay, ConsentSheet
- ReportActivity header � back arrow + two-tone Bugpunch wordmark + signed-in user avatar circle, replacing the "BUG REPORT" eyebrow
- Editor toolbar � main-toolbar inject via reflection (Unity 6000.0+ has no public MainToolbarElement API)
- Test project � DebugModeButton auto-spawns via RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod so the in-game Request Help button is visible in every scene

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-17

### Changed
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- sdk: v0.6.0 - sdk: Bugpunch.SetAccount(provider, username, email?) + Bugpunch.ClearAccounts() G�� declare extra player identities (Parse, Steam, in-game name etc.); attached to reports as reporter.extraAccounts; PII-gated to debug mode only
- sdk(ios): pre-build for xcframework CI
- auth: dashboard SSO + SDK SetAccount + native SDK SSO picker (P1+P2+P3)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- sdk: Bugpunch.SetAccount(provider, username, email?) + Bugpunch.ClearAccounts() � declare extra player identities (Parse, Steam, in-game name etc.); attached to reports as reporter.extraAccounts; PII-gated to debug mode only
- sdk: native Google + Apple sign-in in profile picker � Android Credential Manager (Google) + CustomTabs (Apple), iOS ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider (Apple) + ASWebAuthenticationSession (Google); profile picker now reachable for external + public roles via chat/feedback/debug entry points (cold-launch auto-prompt remains internal-only)
- sdk(config): BugpunchConfig adds googleClientIdIos, googleClientIdAndroid, appleServiceId, appleRedirectUri � empty value hides the corresponding button
- sdk(android): new gradle deps � androidx.credentials, googleid, androidx.browser
- sdk(ios): Sign in with Apple capability + com.apple.developer.applesignin entitlement required on host game's Apple Developer App ID
- sdk: Apple-on-Android round-trip is scaffolded but the deep-link receiver + server callback are TODO (iOS Apple + Google both platforms fully wired today)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- sdk(ios): fix link errors � extern "C" on BPPickerRestoreIdentityIntoRuntime def + Bugpunch_SetFeedbackUnreadCount forward decl
- sdk(android+ios): profile picker always shown on launch; persisted identity hydrated into runtime so reports keep working until fresh pick
- sdk(android): always-on BugpunchTouchRecorder ring (54000 events) � public-role reports get touch breadcrumbs; tester role now drives debug recorder instead of debugBuild flag

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed
- sdk: tools panel migrated from Activity to View overlay (Android + iOS) � Unity stays foreground, tool callbacks fire immediately instead of queuing until panel closes
- sdk: native debug-consent flow � dashboard "Ask Connect" surfaces a native consent sheet (Android BugpunchDebugConsentDialog + iOS counterpart) for public-role players; decision POSTed via /api/device-poll/debug-decision
- sdk: action-gated public-role login (BugpunchEmailEntry.ensurePublicAuthThen) � chat / feedback / debug-mode entry on public devices reshows the prefilled email dialog every time and only proceeds after signin
- sdk: new Bugpunch.SetPlayerEmail C# API � game seeds the public-role login email so players only have to tap Login (persisted in PlayerPrefs + pushed to native)
- sdk: upload status banner ignores "quiet" manifests (analytics / perf / directive acks); count + peek only reflect user-visible issue uploads (crashes / exceptions / ANRs / bug reports / feedback)
- sdk: C# OnDebugConsentResult receiver + DebugRequestInfo envelope parsing for the poll-upgrade path

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- sdk: rename SetCustomData ? SetTag with typed overloads (Vector2/3/4, Color, DateTime, TimeSpan, IDictionary batch); add RemoveTag / ClearTags
- sdk: auto-tag collector (BugpunchAutoTags) � bp.platform, bp.renderPipeline, bp.qualityLevel, bp.graphicsApi, bp.gpuTier, bp.scene, bp.focused, bp.lastUi/Button/Canvas, bp.orientation, bp.network, bp.uptimeBucket
- sdk: post-build source upload (Assets/**/*.cs zip) so dashboard renders real source around crash blame; toggle BugpunchConfig.sourceUploadEnabled
- sdk: stamp reporter identity (role/provider/id/email/name/avatarUrl) on every issue + crash drain manifest across all lanes; persist identity across launches
- sdk: send device context (model/os/memory/screen/dpi) on poll register + config fetch so server sessions table feeds rule autocomplete + crash-group breakdowns
- sdk(ios): 5-arg Bugpunch_SetPlayerIdentity variant with avatarUrl; 4-arg backcompat retained without dropping avatar

## [3.0.2] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- sdk: hierarchy snapshot on reports + tester-gated upload banner with issue details
- sdk(csharp): HierarchySnapshot � full tree on Bugpunch.Report/Feedback, lean tree on scene change, staged for native upload attachment rule
- sdk(android): upload banner shows issue type + title (two-line pill), gated to tester/internal builds or active debug recording, minimum show duration
- sdk(ios): upload banner shows issue type + title (two-line pill), tester/recording-gated, minimum show duration
- sdk(android): BugpunchScreenshot � drop unused display-rotation handling

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- iOS xcframework binary: v3.0.0 shipped a stale artifact because `gh run list --limit 1` raced workflow startup and picked the previous run. This release ships the correct artifact (run 25908107752, sha 32501564) with the iOS log-ring rework binary included. Script now keys lookup by HEAD sha.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- log ring overhaul (Android + iOS): mmap'd ring buffer survives SIGKILL / OOM / force-stop; previous-launch ring rotated for next-launch recovery
- log ring overhaul (Android): logdr socket protocol replaces liblog reader API; 256KB?1MB ring; native owns flush (Java drops periodic flusher)
- log ring overhaul (iOS): OSLogStore polled into the ring every ~1s on a dispatch queue, ships logs while Unity is frozen
- refactor: IdeTunnel dispatches frame type via one JsonUtility parse instead of eight `.Contains` checks
- refactor: ActionExecutor uses ConcurrentDictionary for button listeners; captured exceptions list now lock-guarded
- refactor: ActionExecutor.NavigatePath caches MemberInfo per (Type, name); WaitMethods type cache adds negative-miss cache + ConcurrentDictionary
- refactor: InputInjector `_disabledDevices` access lock-protected across TearDown/quitting race
- refactor: BugpunchClient split into partials (BugpunchClient.JsonHelpers.cs + BugpunchClient.Tunnel.cs); main file 2302?1966 lines
- refactor: BugpunchEditorQuickTaskHotkey 3430?619 lines; Dialog / BrowserSettings / Runner extracted to own files
- refactor: BugpunchAnrWatchdog extracted from BugpunchCrashHandler.java (top-level peer, same package)
- refactor: BugpunchRuntime.updateSystemInfo wrapped in lock to prevent merge lost-update under concurrent patches

## [2.1.9] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- (no commit log provided)

## [2.1.8] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- (no commit log provided)

## [2.1.7] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- **Native dialog polish across iOS.** `BugpunchProfilePicker`, `BugpunchEmailEntry`, `BugpunchReportForm`, `BugpunchDebugWidget`, `BugpunchConsentSheet`, and `BugpunchFeedbackViewController` reworked for consistent typography, spacing, and color tokens. New `BugpunchPretty` helper centralises the shared styling primitives.
- **Brand logo asset shipped to native lanes.** `bp_brand_logo.png` added under Android `res/drawable/` and `package/Plugins/iOS/`, used by the native chat / feedback / consent surfaces.
- **`WebRTCStreamer` rewrite (C#).** Major restructure of the Editor + Standalone WebRTC streamer for cleaner lifecycle, fewer races on connect/disconnect, and reduced per-frame allocations. Public `IStreamer` surface unchanged.
- **Tunnel cleanup across all three lanes.** `BugpunchTunnel.java`, `BugpunchTunnel.mm`, and C# `IdeTunnel.cs` aligned on shared frame envelope + reconnect/backoff semantics.

### Fixed
- **iOS feedback form orphan constraints.** `BugpunchFeedbackViewController` referenced an undeclared `cancelBtn` — broke the xcframework build. Constraints removed; layout is attach + submit only for now.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **Catalog upload now stamps the APK's version, not the next build's.** `BugpunchPostBuildHook` deferred catalog + artifact uploads via `EditorApplication.delayCall`, which fired AFTER `BuildVersionIncrementer` (cbOrder=9999) bumped `PlayerSettings.bundleVersion`. Catalog landed under v+1 while the shipped APK emitted events at v → goals stuck at 0%. Snapshot `Application.version` synchronously at hook entry and thread through.
- **Symbol upload "An item with the same key has already been added. Key: Expect" crash.** Setting `DefaultRequestHeaders.ExpectContinue=false` on Mono's HttpClient mutates a shared dict that throws on the second request. Moved the per-request setting onto each S3 part PUT instead.

### Added
- **`BugpunchNative.FlushAnalyticsNow()`** (Java + iOS + C#). Goal observations call it after `LogDesign("goal.observed", …)` so the dashboard reaction lands within a second instead of waiting for the 15 s native flush timer. Cross-lane.
- **"Goal Reached" log line.** `GoalReporter.FireObserved` emits `Goal Reached: id="…" name="…" value=…` (visible in adb logcat under the Unity tag) the moment a goal observation lands — QA gets local confirmation without waiting for the dashboard round-trip.

### Changed
- **Editor `BuildHooks.cs` split into six focused files** (`IdeConnectAutoUploads`, `BugpunchServerReachabilityPreprocessor`, `BugpunchBuildFingerprintPreprocessor`, `BugpunchCatalogUploadPostprocessor`, `BugpunchTypeDatabaseUploadPostprocessor`, `BugpunchArtifactUploadPostprocessor`). Post-build uploads now run synchronously in the post-build phase — no `delayCall` indirection.
- **Fingerprint preprocessor moved to `int.MaxValue` callbackOrder** so it runs last among preprocessors; ensures the stamped version / commit / built-at reflect any earlier preprocess-hook mutations.
- **Symbol upload throughput.** `PartsPerFileConcurrency` 4 → 8; `HttpClientHandler.MaxConnectionsPerServer` + `ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit` raised to 64 (Mono legacy default of 2 was choking parallel part PUTs); `ExpectContinue=false` on each part PUT saves 1 RTT; smallest-first ordering so the file-count progress moves early.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **Tunnel no longer force-reconnects every 35 s.** Android (`BugpunchTunnel.java`) and iOS (`BugpunchTunnel.mm`) library-level pongs now bump `mLastPongMs` / `lastPongMs`. Previously only app-level `{type:"pong"}` text frames updated it — and the SDK never sent the matching `{type:"heartbeat"}` request, so the watchdog kept timing out and dropping the socket. Reconnect storm + Caddy 502 cascade on the server should stop.

### Added
- **Multi-step set goals via `Bugpunch.Goal<TEnum>(id, text)`.** Declare once with an enum; emit one variant per hit via `Bugpunch.Goal("id", EnumValue)`. Progress = distinct(seen ∩ expected) / |expected|. Cell renders a chip strip (☑/☐ per variant) on the QA Goals dashboard. Goes fully green when every variant has been observed.
- **Build-time set-goal coverage warning.** `BuildCatalogExporter` runs after the scan and logs every set goal that has a declared variant with no matching `Bugpunch.Goal(id, EnumType.Variant)` emit anywhere in the player assemblies. Warning only — QA can raise a task from the row.

### Changed
- **Goal observations are exception-aware.** `GoalReporter.Observe` now drops if a managed exception fired in the last 5 s and waits 500 ms after the call to re-check that no exception lands during the window. Crashes-near-success no longer paint the row green. Hook is one-line: `BugpunchCrashHandler.OnLogMessage` / `Forward` call `GoalReporter.NoteException`.
- **`BuildVersionIncrementer` reordered.** No code change, but consumers should be aware: the catalog is uploaded with the post-bump `Application.version`, which is what the APK embeds — events from the APK match the catalog's `buildVersion` exactly. Mismatches you may see on the dashboard come from a device still running an older install.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **IL2CPP method-map upload is now one POST regardless of ABI count.** New endpoint `POST /api/symbols/il2cpp-mapping/upload-multi` accepts `{ buildIds: [...], file }`. Server hashes the gzipped mapping (SHA-256) and stores it content-addressed at `symbols/mappings/{sha}.il2cpp.json.gz`; every matching `debug_symbols` row is pointed at the shared blob in one DB pass. The client-side `IL2CppMappingUploader` was rewritten around the new endpoint — sends one multipart body with a JSON array of build-IDs in the `buildIds` form field. Previous per-build-ID loop (parallelised to 6-way in v2.1.3) is gone. End-to-end IL2CPP-map phase now ~5-10 s flat regardless of ABI count or stale build-ID accumulation. Server endpoint requires v2.1.4 server (deployed alongside this release).

## [2.1.3] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **IL2CPP method-map upload now parallelised 6-way** (`IL2CppMappingUploader`). Previously a sequential `foreach` over every `libil2cpp` build-ID. Same ~300 KB mapping POSTed once per build-ID, server gunzip + parse + S3 sidecar PUT + DB upsert dominates wall time at ~5–10 s/call, so 10 build-IDs took ~120 s. Drops to ~20 s on the same server with no API change. Same `SemaphoreSlim` shape as the .so uploader.
- **Batch-mode heartbeat thread.** `Application.isBatchMode` runs have no editor progress dialog, so a multi-minute upload used to render as total silence in CI logs. A daemon thread now writes one INFO line every 5 s with elapsed time, current stage label, per-file live progress (MB done / MB total / MB/s / N/total complete), and falls back to discovery / extract status when no upload is in flight. Exits when the upload returns; never throws into the upload path.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **Symbol upload progress dialog now reports the actual sub-phase.** The "Checking server for missing symbols — N files, X MB total (Ys elapsed)" line was a catch-all that fired for every state between Extracting and final teardown, so a multi-minute xdelta3 seed download or IL2CPP method-map upload would render as "Checking server" with a stale file count. `SymbolUploadClient` now publishes a `CurrentStage` label at every transition (`filtering local cache`, `parallel upload starting`, `<file>: hashing for delta /init`, `<file>: POST /delta/init`, `<file>: downloading seed from S3`, `<file>: xdelta3 encoding patch`, `<file>: PUT patch to S3`, `<file>: POST /delta/complete`, `<file>: direct upload`, `uploading IL2CPP method-map for source-line resolution`). `SymbolUploader.PumpInteractive` prefers the stage label over the generic message and shows it as a prefix when per-file live progress is also available. Every stage is also logged at INFO so offline diagnosis works from the editor log.
- **Symbol upload no longer re-ships stale artifacts from prior builds.** Discovery now applies an mtime floor anchored to `BuildReport.summary.buildStartedAt` (minus 30 s of clock-skew slack):
  - Pass 1 skips `*symbols*.zip` files in the build output dir that pre-date the current build (Unity rotates them but doesn't delete the previous zip).
  - Pass 2 skips `*.so` files under `Library/Bee/Android/Prj/.../merged_native_libs/` that pre-date the current build (Bee keeps per-variant folders around).
  - Result: a workspace that's been built five times no longer tries to upload all five generations' libil2cpp every time. Previously seen as a 1.5 GB+ symbol upload on a SymbolTable-level build that should have been ~280 MB.
- New diagnostic log lines surface `Pass N: added X file(s), Y MB` and `Pass 2: skipped N stale .so file(s)` so you can audit what's being shipped.

### Tooling
- VS Code `Build SDK DLLs` task hardened: each DLL copy now strips `read-only` first (`attrib -r`) and fails loud with `errorlevel 1` if the destination is locked (e.g. Unity holding a file handle). Avoids the prior silent-skip case where the build step would succeed but the destination DLL stayed stale.
- `Tools~/xdelta3/macos/{arm64,x86_64}/xdelta3` and `Tools~/xdelta3/windows/xdelta3.exe` now have the executable bit set in the git index (100755). Stops `cp -r` from failing with permission-denied when syncing staging → distribution on Unix-y filesystems, and makes the macOS binaries actually executable when checked out on macOS without a manual `chmod`.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- **SDK CPU/disk reductions across all three lanes.**
  - `PerformanceService.Sample` now only fires when the IDE tunnel is connected — public-role release builds skip the 1 Hz Profiler queries entirely.
  - WebRTC blit + encode pauses when `RTCPeerConnectionState != Connected` — no GPU spent during `Connecting` or transient `Disconnected` limbo.
  - `ConsoleService` flush cadence 100 → 250 ms; Android tunnel log drain 200 → 500 ms. Error-burst overflow path (32 KB) and per-line E/F severity flush unchanged so error visibility is preserved.
  - Android MediaCodec defaults 30 fps / 2 Mbps → 24 fps / 1.2 Mbps; iOS ring recorder matches. `BugpunchFpsGovernor` still scales further on thermal pressure. Server-side `video.fps` / `video.bitrate` config override unchanged.
  - Upload queue capped at 50 oldest manifests (Android + iOS) with attached-file cleanup on prune so an offline device can't fill the cache dir.
  - `closeVideoRing()` deletes `bp_video.dat` on clean exit — an app uninstalled before upload no longer leaves a ~30 MB orphan in the cache dir.

### Added
- In-flight changes already on master (BuildHooks, SymbolUploader, BuildUploadGate, IdeTunnel resilience, BugpunchTunnel native diagnostics, BugpunchPoller, BugpunchRetry, BugpunchScreenPipeline).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Internal-tester profile picker** — first launch on a new internal device prompts for username + password (verified against the dashboard auth backend); subsequent launches show a top-N picker of testers who have authenticated on this device, no password required. New table `device_authenticated_users` (sha1(deviceId|userId)) keys the picker. Native dialogs (`BugpunchProfilePicker.java/.mm`) mirror the existing `BugpunchConsentSheet` styling. Public API: `Bugpunch.ShowProfilePicker()` for debug-menu binding; auto-triggers from `RestorePlayerAuth` when no identity is persisted on internal devices.
- **External / public email-entry auth** — external testers MUST supply an email on first launch (non-cancellable dialog); public players follow a per-project setting (`email_required` / `email_optional` / `none`). New endpoints `GET /api/v1/projects/:projectId/profiles/auth-config` + `POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/profiles/email-signin`. Native dialogs `BugpunchEmailEntry.java/.mm`. Identity persists to `PlayerPrefs` under the existing `Bugpunch.PlayerAuth.*` keys.
- **Profile avatars** — dashboard `/me/avatar` endpoints (POST/GET/DELETE, 256×256 PNG) + `app_users.avatar_s3_key` column. `AccountTab.tsx` got a drag-drop / file-picker uploader. Identity envelopes from `/profiles/top` etc. now carry presigned `avatarUrl`. SDK downloads + caches per-user avatar PNGs to a 50-entry LRU under `<deviceCacheDir>/bugpunch_avatar_cache/<userId>.png` (`BugpunchAvatarCache.java/.mm`). Picker rows fall back to initials placeholder while loading or on failure.
- **Symbol seed cache** — `Library/Bugpunch/SymbolSeedCache/` (LRU N=3, configurable via `BugpunchConfig.symbolSeedCacheCount`) keeps the last few uploaded `.so` files on disk. When the server's `/delta/init` picks a seed build-ID we already have cached, the SDK skips the ~500 MB S3 seed download entirely. Set `symbolSeedCacheCount = 0` on CI workspaces to disable caching and save disk.
- **Symbol upload deduplication folded into `/upload-direct/init`** — replaces the upfront `/api/symbols/check` round-trip that contended on `better-sqlite3`'s synchronous event loop and routinely took 90+ s under prod load. Server now returns `{ skip: true }` when the build-ID already exists for the project; SDK skips the PUT entirely. Per-file dedup parallelises via the existing 6-way init concurrency (~150 ms wall time vs 94 s before for a 14-file batch).
- **Source-location metadata on goals** — Cecil scanner extracts file + line via PDB sequence points; `BugpunchEditorGoals` runtime hook captures `StackTrace` for edit-time-registered goals. Surfaces in the dashboard ? popover.

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **`Bugpunch.Goal` description parameter renamed to `instructions`** — text shown in the QA dashboard ? popover. Existing call sites must rename `description:` to `instructions:`.
- **`Bugpunch.Goal` 2-arg observation form is now scanner-extracted** — `Bugpunch.Goal(id, observedValue)` at any inline site self-registers via the build-time scanner; no separate `Bugpunch.Goal(id, text, expected)` declaration required for simple boolean / scalar checks. Server falls back to title-cased id when no label provided. Dynamic ids (`$"buy_{sku.Id}"`) still work through the runtime `EditorGoalHookBootstrap` path.
- **`BugpunchEditorGoals.Add` is now `internal`** — game-side editor scripts use `Bugpunch.Goal(...)` directly; the runtime hook diverts edit-time calls into the catalog.

### Fixed
- **`xdelta3` binary path on Windows** — `Process.Start` couldn't resolve the relative `Packages/au.com.oddgames.bugpunch/Tools~/xdelta3/windows/xdelta3.exe` even though `File.Exists` returned true. `XdeltaBinary.Resolve()` now returns `Path.GetFullPath(...)` so the spawn finds it.
- **Symbol-upload Cancel button now actually cancels** — was 100 ms `Thread.Sleep` polling on the Editor main thread, which serialised input delivery. Now 10 ms poll + force `HttpClient.CancelPendingRequests` + `Dispose()` on cancel so Mono's HttpClientHandler can't stall the dismiss.
- **Symbol-upload `/check` 15 s deadline + treat-all-as-missing fallback** — moot once `/check` is gone (this release retires the endpoint), but defensive against any remaining client paths.
- **Reflective `UnitySendMessage` in new Java dialogs** — was importing `com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer` directly, which doesn't exist on the standalone AAR classpath. Now uses the same `Class.forName(...)` reflection pattern as `BugpunchImagePicker`.
- **Preflight no longer warns on `Tools~/` and other Unity-hidden directories** — `~`-suffixed and dotfile-prefixed paths skipped in the meta-companion check.

### Removed
- `POST /api/symbols/check` endpoint usage on the SDK side. Server endpoint remains for back-compat with older shipped builds; new SDK never calls it.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Goal API reduced to one method.** Replaces `Bugpunch.RegisterGoal` /
  `Bugpunch.GoalReached` / `Bugpunch.GoalProgress`. Three call shapes:
  - **Declare:** `Bugpunch.Goal(id, text, expected, priority?, description?)` — no-op at runtime; Cecil scanner extracts at build.
  - **Observe:** `Bugpunch.Goal(id, observedValue)` — fires `goal.observed`. `id` may be dynamic.
  - **Declare + poll:** `Bugpunch.Goal(id, text, expected, () => value, priority?, description?)` — sync or async lambda polled every ~10 s.
  Type `T` ∈ { string, int, long, float, double, bool }. `Priority` enum: `Normal` (default) or `Important`. Optional `description` for QA notes.
- **One goal per item** — covers / multi-step expected sets removed. For "every X" coverage, declare one goal per X (use `BugpunchEditorGoals.Add` in an editor script when X is dynamic).
- Server matches incoming `goal.observed` events on equality against the catalog goal's `expected` value. Only one goal kind exists now (`goal`); the prior `expression` / `manual` / `callback` kinds are gone.

### Added
- **`Bugpunch.Priority`** enum (`Normal`, `Important`) on every declare overload — drives QA Goals dashboard sort order. NEW badges remain auto-computed by age, not authored.
- **Optional `description`** parameter on every declare overload — long-form QA notes shown in the dashboard ? popover.
- **`BugpunchEditorGoals.Add(id, text, expected, priority?)`** in the Editor DLL — programmatic build-time goal registration for editor scripts (`IPreprocessBuildWithReport` hooks scanning a ScriptableObject inventory). Drained into `BugpunchBuildCatalog.json` after the Cecil scan.
- **Edit-time hook** — `Bugpunch.Goal(...)` calls executed in the Editor (static initializers, build hooks, asset post-processors) divert through `EditorGoalHookBootstrap` into the same edit-time registry. Lets editor scripts use the runtime API for dynamic ids.
- **Source-location metadata** captured per goal — file path + line via Mono.Cecil sequence points (Cecil scan) or `System.Diagnostics.StackTrace` (edit-time hook). Surfaces in the dashboard "?" popover.
- **`Bugpunch.Goal` evaluator polling** via `GoalReporter` — replaces the old `CallbackGoalRegistry`. Fires `goal.observed` whenever the lambda's value changes (deduped against the previous value).

### Removed
- `Bugpunch.RegisterGoal`, `Bugpunch.GoalReached`, `Bugpunch.GoalProgress` — folded into `Bugpunch.Goal`.
- `BugpunchGoals` ScriptableObject + `Assets/Resources/BugpunchGoals.asset` authoring path. Goals come exclusively from build-time call sites + `BugpunchEditorGoals.Add` now.
- `Operator` enum (Equals / GreaterThan / Contains / …) — equality is the only matching mode; thresholds are expressed in the evaluator lambda (`() => score >= 1000`).
- Server `kind: "expression" | "manual" | "callback"` evaluators + DSL — `goal` is the only kind.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`Bugpunch.RegisterGoal(key, value, predicate)`** — predicate-driven runtime goal API. Pair a `(key, value)` literal tuple with a predicate the SDK polls (every ~10s + on scene change + on app focus); on first true, fires `goal.reached(key, value)`. String + numeric value overloads. Cecil scanner extracts the literals at build time so the dashboard sees the goal before any tester runs.
- **`Bugpunch.GoalReached(key, value)`** — direct one-shot programmatic goal event. Use when the game observes the condition without needing a polled predicate. String + numeric overloads.
- **`Bugpunch.GoalProgress(key, value)`** — accumulating progress event for thresholds and counters. String + numeric overloads. Server-side goals match against the running max / min as appropriate.
- **QA Goals dashboard page** (`/coverage`, under the *Tasks* group) — single-build detail grid plus a multi-build helicopter heatmap. Per-platform progress cells, per-tester role chips (Internal / External / Public), category grouping, contributors leaderboard with email lookup, IMPORTANT priority + auto NEW badge, completion confetti, sidebar colour stripe.

### Removed
- **`ODDGames.BugpunchSdk.Editor.BugpunchEditorGoals`** entire class — including `RegisterBuildGoal`, `AddCoversGoal`, `AddCountGoal`, `AddSumGoal`, `ProgrammaticGoal`, `GoalDefinitionDto`, etc. The DSL grew faster than its usefulness; replaced by the simpler runtime API. For data-driven goal sets, fall back to a loop of `Bugpunch.RegisterGoal(key, value, predicate)` calls — the Cecil scanner reads each literal pair as a separate goal.

### Changed
- `BuildCatalogExporter` slimmed: only `BugpunchGoals.asset` (designer SO) + `CallbackGoalScanner` (Cecil scan of `Bugpunch.RegisterGoal` call sites) feed the catalog `goals[]` payload now. Procedural editor-side registration path retired.
- `BugpunchBuildFingerprintHook` writes a JSON stamp `{ buildHash, version, commit, builtAt }` instead of a raw UUID. `Bugpunch.LogDesign` now injects `_bp_buildHash` + `_bp_buildBuiltAt` into every event's properties dict so the server can disambiguate two builds shipped with the same `Application.version`.
- `Bugpunch.MarkCoverage` doc rewritten — fires `coverage.method` events; pair with an expression goal in `BugpunchGoals.asset` to count hits.

### Fixed
- Symbol-upload progress dialog stuck on a generic "Uploading symbols to server (N files)…" line during the `/check` round-trip — now reports file count, total MB, and elapsed seconds while the live tracker spins up.

## [1.8.24] - 2026-05-13

### Changed
- **Goal system refactor — kind-discriminated expressions.** Coverage goals are now tasks with one of three kinds: `expression` (server evaluates a match+complete predicate over analytics events via DuckDB), `manual` (QA tick-off via dashboard with a `requiredCompleters` threshold), or `callback` (game registers `Bugpunch.RegisterGoal(literalLabel, predicate)` — Cecil scans the literal at build time, runtime polls the predicate, dashboard sees the goal before any tester completes it). Single-event semantics (button / scene / iap / ad) are gone — those become expression goals over the matching analytics event types.

### Added
- **`Bugpunch.RegisterGoal(label, predicate)`** — runtime callback goal API with sync + async overloads. Predicate is polled every 10s + on scene change + on app focus; latches per session on first true. Label MUST be a string literal so the build-time scanner can extract it for catalog seeding.
- **`BugpunchGoals` ScriptableObject** — designer-authored expression / manual goals, custom Inspector loads from any `Resources/` folder.
- **`BugpunchEditorGoals.RegisterBuildGoal(ProgrammaticGoal)`** — procedural editor API with the new `GoalDefinitionDto` shape (match.where[] predicates with props/context source, complete agg/op/value or covers-set).
- **`BuildCatalogExporter`** merges goals from all three sources into `BugpunchBuildCatalog.json` for catalog upload.

### Removed
- `[BugpunchCoverage]` and `[BugpunchGoal]` attributes.
- `CoverageGoalWeaver`, `CoverageGoalILPostProcessor`, `CoverageStaticScanner` — the static IL-weave path is gone in favour of `MarkCoverage` + a matching expression goal.

### Fixed
- **iOS:** `BugpunchPoller.mm` forward-declares its internal `BPDoPoll` / `BPParseIso8601` / `BPPersistChatActivity` so earlier-in-the-file dispatch handlers compile under Clang.
- **iOS:** `BugpunchRingRecorder.mm` imports `BugpunchRuntime.h` so `BPRuntime` is visible to the writer side.

## [1.8.23] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Bug-report form rework (Android + iOS).** Adds a mandatory **Title** input (replaces the programmatic title that was never user-editable). Existing **Description** field renamed to **Reproduce steps** and stays mandatory. Empty title or empty repro steps surfaces an inline warning on Send. Screenshot card and video timeline now share the same slot via a segmented **Screenshot / Video** tab at the top of the media area; no video footage → tab hides, screenshot card behaves as before. Landscape layout wraps the media column in a scrollview so the taller video section fits without clipping. Inner "VIDEO RANGE" sublabel removed (tab labels it).
- **New string keys** on `BugpunchStrings`: `reportFormReproStepsLabel`, `reportFormReproStepsRequired`, `reportFormTitleRequired`, `reportFormMediaScreenshot`, `reportFormMediaVideo`. Translation overrides can supply per-locale strings; defaults match English.

## [1.8.22] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Native-first poller startup.** `BugpunchPoller.start` now runs from the Android `BugpunchInitProvider` / iOS `+load` bootstrap, before Unity boots — `POST /api/devices/register` fires immediately and the device appears in the dashboard's Devices page within a second of process start (not 30s+ after Unity is ready). The register response's bootstrap envelope (roleConfig + gameConfig + scripts + directives + upgradeToWebSocket) is cached natively and replayed to Unity via `UnitySendMessage` once `UnityPlayer` boots, so `OnGameConfig` / `OnPollScripts` / etc. land on the managed client without waiting for the next 60s poll tick.
- **`BugpunchPoller.start(Context, ...)`** signature on Android — the prior `Activity` overload is kept for back-compat (the C# JNI bridge still passes one) but internal methods are `Context`-based so the ContentProvider can drive registration before any Activity exists.
- **`BugpunchClient.StartConnectionMode` skips `StartPollMode`** when the native poller is already running (`BugpunchNative.IsPollerRunning()`), then calls a new `ReplayCachedBootstrap()` that pulls the cached envelope via `BugpunchNative.GetCachedBootstrap()` and re-dispatches it through the existing managed receivers. Belt-and-braces with the native `attachActivity` replay path on Android; sole replay path on iOS.

## [1.8.21] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Uploader drop log now includes server response body snippet** (Android `BugpunchUploader`). `[Bugpunch.Uploader]: dropping after 1 attempts (HTTP 403): https://api.bugpunch.com/api/v1/perf/events` was opaque — the actual cause (project-id-required, forbidden, invalid-key, etc.) lived in the response body that we discarded. Now logs ` — body: <first 200 chars of response>` so logcat reveals which gate fired without needing server-side log access. Diagnostic only; no behavioural change.

## [1.8.20] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Public facade reverted from `BugpunchSdk` back to `Bugpunch`.** The namespace `ODDGames.Bugpunch` is renamed to `ODDGames.BugpunchSdk` instead — that removes the collision the v1.8.17 class rename was meant to solve. Call sites now read as `Bugpunch.Report(...)` after `using ODDGames.BugpunchSdk;` (no name shadowing because `BugpunchSdk` is the namespace and `Bugpunch` is the class — full path `ODDGames.BugpunchSdk.Bugpunch`). Sub-namespaces follow: `ODDGames.BugpunchSdk.UI`, `.RemoteIDE`, `.Editor`, `.Bridge`, `.Samples`. Assembly + DLL filenames stay `ODDGames.Bugpunch.dll` etc. so Unity asmdef references don't break. **Breaking** for game code that adopted v1.8.17/v1.8.18's `BugpunchSdk.Foo()` — revert call sites to `Bugpunch.Foo()` and update any `using ODDGames.Bugpunch;` → `using ODDGames.BugpunchSdk;`.

## [1.8.19] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **iOS dSYM upload fails build with HTTP 400, killing the Xcode archive.** Two bugs in the post-process build phase script installed by `iOSSymbolUploadHook`:
  1. The S3 part ETag captured from `UploadPart`'s response header had its surrounding quotes stripped before being sent to `/api/symbols/upload-direct/complete`. AWS's `CompleteMultipartUpload` matches the ETag byte-for-byte against what S3 returned (quotes-and-all), so the upload was rejected. The Android/C# `SymbolUploadClient` already kept the quotes — iOS now matches.
  2. Even when the upload genuinely failed, `curl`'s diagnostic ("curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 400") was bleeding the literal substring `error:` into Xcode's build log. Jenkins (and other CI wrappers) commonly `grep -q error:` the log to decide whether the Archive succeeded, so the surrounding build was being failed by our script's text even though we exited 0. The script now (a) drops `set -e` so a single bad command doesn't abort, (b) rewrites `error:` → `issue:` on its own stderr via `exec 2> >(sed …)`, and (c) hard-forces `exit 0` in the `EXIT` trap. Symbol upload remains best-effort; it can never fail the surrounding build again.

## [1.8.18] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **Device now registers on every build.** Previously only release-public builds called `POST /api/devices/register` — debug + cached-internal builds opened the IDE WebSocket directly and never created a `Device` row in the dashboard. Result: bug reports flowed but the device was invisible in the Devices page and couldn't be assigned a tester role. `BugpunchClient.StartConnectionMode()` now always invokes `StartPollMode()` first; the WS opens eagerly for debug + cached-internal devices on top of that.
- **Android HTTP 403 from `/api/v1/perf/events` + `/api/v1/analytics/events`.** Default `HttpURLConnection` `User-Agent: Java/x.x.x` tripped Cloudflare's browser-integrity check (error 1010) and some carrier middleboxes. Every Android HTTP entry point now sets `User-Agent: Bugpunch-Android-SDK` (uploader, poller, chat, crash drain, generic helper).
- **Tools button in floating debug widget did nothing.** The widget bounced through Unity (`UnitySendMessage("BugpunchToolsBridge", "OnShowTools", "")`) targeting a MonoBehaviour that was never auto-spawned. Flow inverted: widget now launches the native panel directly (Android Activity / iOS view controller), which then asks Unity for fresh tool data via `OnRequestTools` and re-paints when C# pushes back via `BugpunchNative.UpdateTools(json)`. The panel always opens, regardless of game-code wiring.

### Changed
- **`BugpunchPoller.start` skips its duplicate immediate poll.** The native register call already returns the full bootstrap payload (roleConfig + gameConfig + scripts + directives + upgradeToWebSocket); the recurring poll now starts one interval (60s) after register instead of firing twice on the same data.
- **`DebugToolsBridge` rewritten as a static utility class.** No longer a `MonoBehaviour`; no GameObject named `BugpunchToolsBridge` needed. Internal contract — game code doesn't call it directly.

## [1.8.17] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Public facade renamed `Bugpunch` → `BugpunchSdk`.** Resolves the class-name vs namespace-tail collision (`ODDGames.Bugpunch.Bugpunch`) that forced consumers to fully qualify every call. With `using ODDGames.Bugpunch;` the facade is now reachable as `BugpunchSdk.Foo()` without ambiguity. **Breaking** for game code — every call site must be updated (`Bugpunch.Report(...)` → `BugpunchSdk.Report(...)`, etc.).

## [1.8.16] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- **`BugpunchRequestHelpPicker` is now `internal`.** Call `Bugpunch.RequestHelp()` instead — the picker class is an implementation detail. No behavioural change; the public facade has always been the supported entry point.

## [1.8.15] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **`BugpunchSystemInfo`** — full + volatile `SystemInfo` snapshots get pushed to native at SDK start and on every scene change. Crash, exception, ANR, and bug-report uploads now carry the rich device-info blob the Remote IDE's `DeviceInfoService` already exposes.

### Changed
- **Native storyboard capture.** `BugpunchInputCapture` now asks native to capture the current Unity surface (Android `PixelCopy` / iOS `drawViewHierarchyInRect`) instead of running `AsyncGPUReadback` in C# and shipping ARGB32 pixel bytes across the JNI / P-Invoke boundary. Sidesteps Y-flip / orientation bugs in `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotIntoRenderTexture` on Vulkan / Metal and stops paying GPU bus bandwidth per press.
- **Editor sessions default to `TesterRole.Internal`.** `RoleState` initializes Editor as Internal so the Console log push to the IDE tunnel is on by default — toolbar toggle drops to Public to mute it. `LogCaptureState` (separate Editor flag) is removed; the single role gate covers Editor + device.

### Fixed
- **iOS linker errors** — undefined-symbol failures for `Bugpunch_ReportBug`, `Bugpunch_TrackEvent`, `BugpunchRing_*`, `BugpunchPerfMonitor_OnSceneChange`, `UnitySendMessage`, etc. Cross-file forward declarations were missing `extern "C"`, so callers used C++ name mangling and missed the C-linkage definitions. Hoisted all forward decls to file scope and wrapped `BugpunchPerfMonitor_*` definitions in `extern "C"`.

## [1.8.14] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Scene-camera draw-distance API.** `POST /scene-camera/draw-distance` with `{far}` sets the scene camera's far clip plane (clamped to [10, 100000]). `GetState` now reports `near` + `far` so dashboards can seed a slider. Scene camera no longer inherits the main camera's clip planes on start — it uses wide defaults (`near=0.05`, `far=10000`) so big scenes don't clip on free-fly. Pairs with the new dashboard slider in the IDE scene-camera toolbar.
- **Editor log-capture toggle.** New `LogCaptureState.EditorEnabled` (runtime) + `BugpunchLogCaptureToggle` (Editor) mirror an `EditorPrefs` flag into the runtime DLL on every domain reload. Lets a developer mute Editor-session log streaming to the IDE tunnel without dropping the tunnel itself. Device builds ignore the flag — their log push is still gated by `RoleState.IsInternal`.

### Changed
- **ConsoleService** consults `LogCaptureState.EditorEnabled` when forwarding logs to the IDE tunnel.

## [1.8.13] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **"Screen position out of view frustum" warning when raycasting through the scene camera.** `SceneCameraService.Raycast` scaled normalized click coords by `Screen.width` / `Screen.height`, but the scene camera renders to a RenderTexture whose `pixelWidth` / `pixelHeight` differs from `Screen.*` (e.g. Editor with docked game view). Switched to `cam.pixelWidth` / `cam.pixelHeight` so coords land inside the camera's actual pixel rect.

## [1.8.12] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Build metadata auto-fill (Changeset + Branch).** `BuildVcsMeta` resolves VCS info for the Register Build window and the post-build artifact uploader. Order: code-side `ChangesetProvider` / `BranchProvider` callbacks → env vars `BP_CHANGESET` / `BP_BRANCH` → Plastic SCM → git. Plastic-only consumers see no behavioural change; git repos now auto-fill too.
- **Placeholder interpolation in build metadata fields.** Changeset, Branch (and anything passed to `BuildVcsMeta.Expand`) accept `${ENV_VAR}` and `[Type.Member.Member(args)]` placeholders. Reflection-evaluated against `UnityEngine`, `UnityEditor`, `System`, `System.IO` roots — e.g. `[Application.version]`, `[DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("yyyyMMdd")]`, `[Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_SHA")]`. Editor-only, runs at submit time.
- **Register Build window help text.** HelpBox + per-field tooltips document the auto-fill chain, placeholder syntax, and the code-side `BuildVcsMeta.ChangesetProvider` / `BranchProvider` override.

## [1.8.11] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **Built-in render pipeline shader compile errors.** Six SDK shaders (`Hidden/Bugpunch/{ColliderWire,UV,Wireframe,Depth,Normals,Overdraw}`) referenced `Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/ShaderLibrary/Core.hlsl` in their URP SubShader. Unity compiles every SubShader regardless of which one the active RP picks, so projects without the URP package failed to compile. Swapped the URP SubShader bodies from `HLSLPROGRAM` + `Core.hlsl` to `CGPROGRAM` + `UnityCG.cginc` — works under URP (legacy include preserved) and Built-in alike. URP still selects the URP SubShader via `RenderPipeline=UniversalPipeline` + `LightMode=UniversalForward` tags.

## [1.8.10] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Storyboard UI-state per press.** Every storyboard frame now carries a compact JSON snapshot of the visible UI at press time: scene, timeScale, frame, focused element, top modal, ≤50 selectables (Button/Toggle/Slider/InputField/Dropdown/Scrollbar w/ values + interactable flag), ≤8 input field values. <2 ms capture cost (cached canvas list, no `FindObjectsByType` on the press path). Surfaces in the dashboard storyboard rail behind a Standard/Detailed toggle.
- **Inverse locator suggestions (`Search.SuggestFor`).** Public C# API: pass a `GameObject`, get back up to 5 ranked `LocatorSuggestion`s — bare-text, type+text, name, type+name, has-parent+text, hierarchy path, plus a normalized-coord `ClickAt` fallback as the last entry. Top candidates verified via `Search.Matches` over a 200-node bounded DFS (≤2 verifications/press). `ActionExecutor.LocatorsFor(GameObject)` is a one-liner forwarder. Used internally by storyboard capture so each press records the locator(s) that would replay it.
- **Editor-only 50-slot storyboard ring.** Editor + Standalone get a managed-side ring (raw ARGB32 in RAM, ~130 MB peak, PNG on dump) so dev-machine reports preserve far more press history than the device-side native ring. Files dump as `bugpunch_storyboard_<i>.png` + `bugpunch_storyboard.json` under `<persistentDataPath>/bugpunch/storyboard/<type>_<tsMs>/`.
- **Clipboard helper for AI hand-off.** On editor `Bugpunch.Report` / `Bugpunch.Feedback`, the SDK copies a paste-ready block to the clipboard naming the dump folder, the JSON shape, and the local `Packages/au.com.oddgames.bugpunch/README.md` API reference. Re-copy any time via the Editor menu `Tools/Bugpunch/Copy Last Storyboard For AI`.
- **`uiState` upload field on Android + iOS storyboard rings.** Mobile lanes now accept and persist a `uiState` string per press (header extended 356 → 2404 bytes, `MAX_SLOTS` unchanged at 10). Server ingests the field and the dashboard renders it in the storyboard drilldown.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Four `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `IssueDetailPanel`.**
  - `setActiveSampleDetail(null)` early-returns inside the sample-detail-fetch effect (3 branches: invalid idx, primary sample, spinner-on) all wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => { if (!cancelled) … })` with cancel guard preserved.
  - Logs prefetch effect's empty-source reset (`setLoadedLogs([])`) wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => { if (!cancelled) setLoadedLogs([]); })`.
  - First-load log-center effect's `setActiveLogTs(String(best.timestamp))` deferred via `queueMicrotask` after the ref-flip.
  - Sample-switch reset effect (5 setStates) — refs flip synchronously, the 5 setStates wrapped in one `queueMicrotask(() => { … })`.
  Lint count down 66 → 62; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `IssueLogPanel.didInitDefaultTag` — Unity-tag preselect deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The "pre-select Unity tag once when it first appears" effect synchronously called `setTagFilter(new Set(['Unity']))`. Wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => setTagFilter(new Set(['Unity'])))`. Ref-guard flip stays synchronous (refs aren't render-affecting). Lint count down 67 → 66; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `ScriptsPage.ScheduleDialog` — modal-open reset moved to mount/key.** The dialog reset 7 state slots (`setName('')`, `setCode('')`, `setTargetType('all')`, …) inside a `useEffect(() => { if (open) … }, [open])`. Parent now only mounts the dialog when `dialogOpen` is true (`{dialogOpen && <ScheduleDialog … />}`) and passes `key={String(dialogOpen)}`, so each open is a fresh mount and the useState initializers handle the reset. Reset effect dropped. Lint count down 68 → 67; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `TasksPage`.**
  - Saved-searches refresh effect (`void refreshSavedSearches()`) → `queueMicrotask(refreshSavedSearches)`.
  - Incoming-questions effect — both branches' setStates wrapped: empty-set reset (`setIncomingQuestions([])`) and spinner-on (`setLoadingIncoming(true)`) wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => { if (!cancelled) … })` so each lands in a callback, with cancel-guard preserved.
  Lint count down 70 → 68; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three more `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared.**
  - `TestResultsPage` — `useEffect(() => loadRuns(), [loadRuns])` → `queueMicrotask(loadRuns)`.
  - `TestDevicesPage` — both `useEffect(() => load(), …)` (initial + project-switch) → `queueMicrotask(load)`.
  Lint count down 73 → 70; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three more `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared.**
  - `TestPlansPage.PlanDetail` — sync prop→state effect (`setName(plan.name); setDescription(plan.description); setTestRefs(plan.tests); setDirty(false)`) dropped; parent already passes `key={selected.id}` so a different plan remounts and useState initializers re-seed.
  - `TestPlansPage` — `useEffect(() => loadData(), [loadData])` → `queueMicrotask(loadData)`.
  - `TestsPage` — `useEffect(() => loadPlans(), [loadPlans])` → `queueMicrotask(loadPlans)`.
  Lint count down 77 → 73; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three more `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `TaskDetailDrawer`.**
  - Comments-loading effect (`setLoadingComments(true); listComments(…)`) — `setLoadingComments(true)` deferred via `queueMicrotask`.
  - `VideoBookmarkRow.label` prop-sync effect dropped — parent already passes `key={bookmark.Id}` so a different bookmark remounts and the useState initializer re-seeds the label. Side benefit: external mutations no longer steal the user's in-progress label edit.
  - Inline-task-picker dialog's search effect (`setLoading(true); listTasks(…)`) — `setLoading(true)` deferred via `queueMicrotask`.
  Lint count down 80 → 77; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Five `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `TaskDetailDrawer` — three sub-components moved to call-site `key` remount.** All three had effects that synchronously mirrored `task` props into local edit state on every change, which doubled as `set-state-in-effect` violations *and* a UX bug (server-poll refreshes clobbered the user's in-progress edits — same anti-pattern fixed earlier on `FeedbackDetail` / `TaskStatusesTab.StatusRow`):
  - `TaskOnePageSections` — dropped `useEffect(() => setRelationsOpen(false), [task.Id])`; parent passes `key={task.Id}`.
  - `TaskTitleBar` — dropped `setTitle(task.Title)` + `setLabelsInput(task.Labels.join(', '))` effects; both call sites pass `key={task.Id}`.
  - `DetailsTab` — dropped `setDescription(task.Description)` + `setLabelsInput(task.Labels.join(', '))` effects; parent passes `key={task.Id}`.
  Lint count down 85 → 80; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two more `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared.**
  - `ServerErrorWatcher`: initial `poll()` call inside the `debugMode`-gated effect deferred via `queueMicrotask(poll)` so the async `setPending` lands in a callback rather than the effect body. setInterval branch already runs through a callback.
  - `TunnelStatusBanner`: synchronous `setShowRecovered(true)` + 1800ms `setShowRecovered(false)` rewritten as two `setTimeout` callbacks (`tShow = setTimeout(…, 0)` / `tHide = setTimeout(…, 1800)`), both cleared on cleanup. Net behaviour identical (one tick microdelay on the show flip is invisible to users) but neither setState sits synchronously in the effect body.
  Lint count down 87 → 85; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `DevicesPage`.** (1) Leading-load thumbnail effect (`if (debugIds.length === 0) return; loadThumbnails();`) wrapped — `loadThumbnails()` now runs via `queueMicrotask(loadThumbnails)` so its async setState lands in a callback. (2) `PollDeviceRow` countdown reset path (`if (!debugRequest) { setCountdown(null); return; }`) replaced by a derived `countdown = debugRequest ? countdownRaw : null` — the displayed countdown collapses to null whenever `debugRequest` clears, no extra render needed. Effect now only ticks while a request is active. Lint count down 89 → 87; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three more `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared across pages.**
  - `GameConfigPage`: `useEffect(() => fetchParams(), [fetchParams])` → `queueMicrotask(fetchParams)`.
  - `PromptDesignerPage.SubStepRow`: `useEffect(() => { if (result.runId) setResolvedRunId(result.runId) }, [result.runId])` wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => setResolvedRunId(result.runId!))`.
  - `RunPage`: deleted the `useEffect(() => { setSelectedId('') }, [runType])` reset effect outright. Both `setRunType('test')` / `setRunType('plan')` button handlers (the only call sites that flip runType) now clear `selectedId` inline — same behavior, no effect-driven cascade.
  Lint count down 92 → 89; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Five `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `ScriptsPage`.** All wrap async callables that the lint rule's static analysis can't trace through:
  - 3× `useEffect(() => { load(); }, [load])` → `queueMicrotask(load)` (the page hosts three sub-views — snippet list, run history, scheduled scripts — each with its own `load` callback that fetches + setStates).
  - 1× `useEffect(() => { loadDevices(); }, [loadDevices])` → `queueMicrotask(loadDevices)`.
  - 1× snippet-selection sync effect (`setDraft({...selected}); setTagsInput(...); setDirty(false); setRunResult(null); setRunError(null)`) wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => { … })`.
  Lint count down 97 → 92; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `DebugToolsPage`.** (1) `useEffect(() => fetchTools(), [fetchTools])` → `queueMicrotask(fetchTools)`. (2) `useEffect(() => fetchDevices(), [fetchDevices])` → `queueMicrotask(fetchDevices)`. (3) The selection-driven `setDraft({...selected}); setDirty(false)` sync effect wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => { … })` so the setState pair lands in a callback rather than the effect body. Lint count down 100 → 97; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `DevicesPage`.** (1) Project-switch re-fetch effect (`useEffect(() => { loadDevices(); }, [activeProject?.id])`) deferred via `queueMicrotask(loadDevices)` so the setState calls inside `loadDevices` land in a callback. (2) `?fingerprint=` URL effect's reset path (`setFingerprintDeviceIds(null); setFingerprintLabel(null)`) and label-set path (`setFingerprintLabel(fp)`) both wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => …)` so the synchronous setState pair leaves the effect body. Lint count down 102 → 100; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `auth.AuthProvider` — projects-refresh effect deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The "load projects when active org changes" effect synchronously called `refreshProjects()`, whose async body sets `setProjects(...)`. Wrapped the initial call in `queueMicrotask(() => { if (cancelled) return; refreshProjects(); })` so the eventual setProjects lands in a callback rather than appearing to lint as an effect-body setState. Cancellation guard preserved. Lint count down 103 → 102; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `useProjectFilter` — first-project auto-select deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The hook's auto-select effect (when no `active_project_id` is saved and `projects` arrives non-empty, pick the first) synchronously called `setProjectIdState(first.id)`. Wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => setProjectIdState(first.id))` so the setState lands in a callback. The localStorage write stays synchronous (DOM I/O — not an effect concern). Lint count down 104 → 103; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `TaskRecentsStrip` — storage re-read deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The component re-read its localStorage-backed recents/collapsed state on every `projectId`/`user?.id` change. A `key`-based remount would've worked too but the parent doesn't get a fresh `activeProject.id` on user changes — the auth identity is read inside the strip via `useAuth()`. Wrapping the setState pair in `queueMicrotask(() => { … })` defers them into a callback. Lint count down 105 → 104; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `ActivityTracker` — auto-expand `setExpanded(true)` deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The auto-expand effect synchronously called `setExpanded(true)` whenever `running > 0`. Wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => setExpanded(true))` so the setState lands in a callback rather than the effect body. Behavior unchanged — user-initiated collapse during running activities still wins because the effect only fires on transitions of `running` count, not on every render. Lint count down 106 → 105; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `LogViewer.anomalyCursor` reset — derived `safeAnomalyCursor` replaces clamp effect.** The component had a `useEffect(() => setAnomalyCursor(prev => …), [anomalies])` that walked the four anomaly kinds (crash/java/unity/anr) and clamped any cursor that pointed past its anomaly array's new length. Replaced with a per-tick `safeAnomalyCursor: Record<AnomalyKind, number>` derivation (one ternary per kind) that the badge UI consumes directly. `stepAnomaly`'s callback also clamps `stored >= arr.length ? 0 : stored` inline so the wrapping math never reads a stale out-of-range cursor. Lint count down 107 → 106; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `LogViewer`.** (1) `setAutoTail(false)` before the imperative `scrollIntoView` (initial-range scroll effect) wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => setAutoTail(false))` so the setState lands in a callback. (2) Cursor-clamp effect (`if (searchIdx >= matchIndices.length) setSearchIdx(0)`) replaced with a `safeSearchIdx = searchIdx >= matchIndices.length ? 0 : searchIdx` derivation — used by `currentMatchVisIdx` lookup and the `N/M` counter display. `stepMatch` updater applies the same clamp inside the `setSearchIdx(i => …)` callback so a stored out-of-range idx wraps cleanly. Same approach as the matching `IssueLogPanel` cleanup last tick. Lint count down 109 → 107; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `IssueLogPanel`.** (1) Spinner-on flip in the log-fetch effect (`setLoading(true)`) wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => { if (!cancelled) setLoading(true); })` so the setState lands in a callback rather than the effect body. (2) Cursor-clamp effect (`if (searchIdx >= matchIndices.length) setSearchIdx(0)`) replaced with a `safeSearchIdx = searchIdx >= matchIndices.length ? 0 : searchIdx` derivation — used by the scroll-into-view effect, the `currentMatchRowIdx` lookup, and the `N/M` counter display. The `step()` callback that increments the cursor still calls `setSearchIdx`, but applies the same clamp inside the updater so an out-of-range stored idx wraps cleanly. Lint count down 111 → 109; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Four `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `TaskStatusesTab` (`StatusRow` + `ReassignDeleteDialog`).** `StatusRow` had three prop-sync effects (`setName(status.Name)` / `setColor(status.Color)` / `setSortOrder(String(status.SortOrder))`) that mirrored each prop into local edit state on every change — same anti-pattern as `FeedbackDetail` (clobbered the user's in-progress edit any time a server poll refreshed the row). Parent already passes `key={status.Id}` so a different status remounts cleanly; dropped all three effects. `ReassignDeleteDialog` had a `useEffect(() => { setTarget(first?.Id ?? '') }, [state, statuses])` that picked the default reassign target whenever the dialog opened — replaced with a `useState` initializer, plus `key={reassignFor?.status.Id ?? 'closed'}` on the parent so each open re-runs the initializer with the right state. Lint count down 115 → 111; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `VideoPlayer` (`NativeVideoPlayer` + `LegacyFramePlayer`).** The shared `VideoPlayer` wrapper now passes `key={videoUrl}` to whichever inner player it picks, so a clip switch unmounts and remounts — `useState` initializers re-seed `streamUrl/error` (Native) and `loading/error/frames/fps` (Legacy) without any synchronous reset inside the fetch effects. NativeVideoPlayer's plain-URL fast path uses `queueMicrotask(setStreamUrl)` so its setState lands in a callback. Lint count down 117 → 115; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `EnvironmentTab.SourceSection` — no-changeset reset folded into useState initializer + call-site `key`.** The component had a synchronous `if (!changeset) { setDetail(null); setLoaded(true); return; }` guard inside its fetch effect. Hoisted: `useState(!changeset)` seeds `loaded=true` on initial mount when no changeset exists, and `EnvironmentTab` now passes `<SourceSection key={view.env?.changeset ?? 'no-changeset'} … />` so a changeset switch unmounts and remounts the section. Effect now early-returns without touching state when `!changeset`. Lint count down 118 → 117; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `HeaderTrendChart` (in `issues/detail/shared.tsx`) — sync reset → call-site `key={view.id}`.** The 30-day sparkline reset `setLoaded(false); setPoints([])` synchronously at the top of its fetch effect on every `groupId` change. `IssueDetailHeader` now passes `key={view.id}` so a group switch unmounts and remounts the chart — useState initializers re-seed both. Lint count down 119 → 118; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `IssueStatsPanel` — spinner-on flip deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The fetch effect synchronously called `setState('loading')` before kicking off the `/api/crashes/groups/:id/stats` request. Wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => { if (!cancelled) setState('loading'); })` so the setState lands in a callback rather than the effect body, and the cancel guard still prevents a stale "loading" flip after a fast unmount. Other transitions (missing/error/ok) already happen in `.then` callbacks. Lint count down 120 → 119; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `LogsTab` — spinner-on flip deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The fetch effect synchronously called `setLoading(true)` before kicking off the network request. Wrapped in `queueMicrotask(() => setLoading(true))` so the setState lands in a callback rather than the effect body. Spinner-off + envelope set already happen in `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally` (lint accepts those). Lint count down 121 → 120; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `IssueMediaSection` — default-tab pick + gallery reset moved to call-site `key`.** The component used a `useEffect(() => { if (hasVideo) setMediaTab('video'); else if (hasShot) setMediaTab('screenshot'); setGalleryIdx(0); }, [hasVideo, hasShot, view.id, ev.primaryEventId])` to pick the right initial tab and reset the gallery index whenever availability flipped or the sample changed. Hoisted: `IssueDetailPanel` now passes `key={primaryEventId:hasVideo:hasShot}` so any of those changing remounts the section, and `useState` initializers seed `mediaTab = hasVideo ? 'video' : (hasShot ? 'screenshot' : 'video')` and `galleryIdx = 0` directly. Lint count down 122 → 121; tsc clean.

### Removed
- **Dead component `components/issues/SampleDetailInline.tsx` deleted.** No imports across the codebase — confirmed via repo-wide grep. The file was a stale "inline-expanded crash sample" view superseded by `components/issues/detail/SamplesTab.tsx`. Removing it also cleared an unaddressable `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` violation (it had a `setLoading(true); setError(null)` synchronous reset on every `groupId`/`sampleId` change). Lint count down 123 → 122; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `AppLayout` badge hooks (`useChatsBadge`, `useFeedbackBadge`, `useTriageBadge`).** Each hook synchronously called `setCount(0)` when token/projectId went missing, then early-returned. Two changes per hook: (a) the signed-out / no-project zero is now derived in the hook's return-value (`return token ? count : 0` / `return token && projectId ? count : 0`) — no setState needed for the reset; (b) the initial `pull()` call is wrapped in `queueMicrotask(pull)` so its async `setCount` lands in a callback rather than the effect body. Polling intervals + focus listeners are unchanged. Lint count down 126 → 123; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `MonacoEditor` — disconnect-clears-diagnostics derived rather than reset.** The live-diagnose effect synchronously called `setLiveDiagnostics([])` when `deviceProxyUrl` was missing, then early-returned. Replaced with a pure-derivation `effectiveLiveDiagnostics = deviceProxyUrl ? liveDiagnostics : []` inside the marker effect — when no device is connected, stale results don't reach Monaco's marker map. The effect now early-returns when `deviceProxyUrl` is null without touching state. Added `deviceProxyUrl` to the marker effect's dep list so disconnect re-renders markers immediately. Lint count down 127 → 126; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `RichEditor.SlashMenu` + `RichEditor.MentionMenu` — measure-and-position pattern moved off React state.** Both popups did the same thing: render at the cursor's `state.x/state.y`, measure the rendered height, then call `setPosition({ top, left })` to flip above the cursor when the menu wouldn't fit below. Replaced with a direct DOM mutation through the existing `menuRef` — `el.style.top = …; el.style.left = …` runs in the same useEffect but doesn't touch React state, so the post-measure render cycle disappears entirely. Initial position lives on the inline `style={{ … }}` so first-paint placement is unchanged. Lint count down 129 → 127; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `VideoPanel.videoUrl` reset — `key={videoUrl}` added at the call site.** The panel reset `setVideoDuration(null)` synchronously when `videoUrl` changed. `SessionViewer` now passes `key={videoUrl ?? 'no-video'}` so a clip switch unmounts and remounts the panel — useState re-seeds videoDuration=null and the `<video>` element's `onloadedmetadata` populates it once the new clip's metadata resolves. The `paused`-driven seek effect at line 132 is left in place (its `setPlaying(false)` is logically tied to the imperative video.pause() call and isn't a derived-state pattern). Lint count down 130 → 129; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `LogViewer.sessionId` reset — `key={selected.id}` added at both call sites.** The viewer reset 6 state slots + 3 refs synchronously when `sessionId` changed. Added `key={selected.id}` to `LogsPanel`'s render and to `LogsPage`'s render, then dropped the reset effect — useState/useRef initializers re-seed lines, selection, tagFilter, tagPanelOpen, tagSearch, nextOffsetRef, bufferedRef, totalBytes, scrolledForRef on remount. Local selection is still per-session (the original intent). Lint count down 131 → 130; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `IssueDetailPanel.view.id` reset — `key={view?.id}` added at all three call sites.** The panel reset 7 state slots + 2 refs synchronously when `view.id` changed. `IssuesPage` already passed `key={selectedId}`; `GlobalTaskControls` and `TasksPage` did not. Added `key={view?.id}` to both, then dropped the reset effect — useState/useRef initializers re-seed videoSec, videoDurationSec, loadedLogs, activeLogTs, expandedSampleId, activeSampleIdx, activeSampleDetail, didCenterLogsRef, didSeekToEventRef on remount. The second reset effect (sample switch within an issue, keyed on `ev.primaryEventId`) is left in place for now — unkeyable from outside without splitting the panel into a sample-keyed sub-component. Lint count down 132 → 131; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `FeedbackDetail` — reset effect dropped (already-keyed parent + better edit semantics).** The detail panel reset `setEditing(false); setEditTitle(item.title); setEditBody(item.body)` whenever `item.id`/`item.title`/`item.body` changed. Parent already renders `<FeedbackDetail key={selected.id} … />` so the id-change branch was redundant; the title/body branch was actively wrong because it clobbered the user's in-progress edits whenever an external mutation arrived for the same item. Dropped the effect entirely — `useState` initializers re-seed on selection change, and external title/body updates no longer steal the user's edits. Lint count down 133 → 132; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `SpeedTestCard` (in `SystemStatsTab`) — already-loaded fast path moved into the `useState` initializer.** The script-load effect synchronously called `setScriptLoaded(true)` when `window.Speedtest` was already populated by another card's earlier mount. Replaced with `useState(() => Boolean(window.Speedtest))` so the same condition runs once during initial render. The effect now only handles listener-attach + script-injection paths whose setState calls live in `onload`/`onerror` callbacks (deferred for the rule). Lint count down 134 → 133; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `BrowseView` (in `DatabaseReaderPanel`).** (1) Reset effect dropped — call site now passes `key={path:table}` so a table switch unmounts and remounts, and `useState` initializers re-seed offset/sort/filter/pending. (2) Initial `load()` wrapped in `queueMicrotask(load)` so the setState calls inside it (`setLoading`, `setErr`, `setResult`) land in a microtask callback rather than the effect body. Lint count down 136 → 134; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `DeviceDetail`.** (1) Initial chat-unread refresh wrapped in `queueMicrotask(refreshChatUnread)` so the async `setChatUnread` lands in a callback rather than the effect body — `usePolling` continues to drive subsequent ticks. (2) The scene-camera-mode effect's synchronous `setSceneCameraError(null)` reset moved into the `.then` of `api.sceneCamera.start()`, so a successful start clears the error and a failure path still flips back to `'game'` with the error message — both setState calls now sit inside async callbacks. Lint count down 138 → 136; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `useDeviceControl` — synchronous reset moved to call-site `key`.** The hook's initial-acquisition effect reset `setState('loading'); setSessionId(null); setController(null)` synchronously on every `deviceId` change. Hoisted: `DevicesPage`'s render of `<DeviceDetail … />` (the hook's only consumer) now passes `key={selectedDevice.id}` so a device switch unmounts and remounts the panel — `useState` initializers in the hook re-seed loading/null. Effect now just runs the status check and calls `claim()` in its async body. Lint count down 139 → 138; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `ConsolePanel.resolveSession` — initial call deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The session-resolver effect synchronously called the async `resolveSession()`, whose body sets `setLogs([])`/`setExpandedIndex(null)` when a new session arrives. Wrapped the initial call in `queueMicrotask(resolveSession)` so the setState calls land in a microtask callback rather than the effect body. `usePolling` below already runs subsequent ticks via an interval callback (deferred for the rule). Same approach as `GameObjectHeader`. Lint count down 140 → 139; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `TextureCanvas` (in `TexturePanel`) — synchronous reset moved to `key={fullUrl}`.** The texture canvas reset `sourceRef.current = null; setLoaded(false); setFailed(false)` synchronously at the top of its image-fetch effect on every `src` change. Hoisted the reset out: parent `TexturePanel`'s render now passes `key={fullUrl}` so a src change unmounts and remounts — `useState`/`useRef` initializers re-seed loaded=false, failed=false, source=null. Channel toggles still re-render against the cached ImageData without remounting (channels are not part of the key). Lint count down 141 → 140; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `InspectorPanel` — synchronous reset moved to call-site `key`.** The panel reset `setLoading(true); setExpandedComp(null)` synchronously at the top of its data-fetch effect on every `deviceId`/`instanceId` change. Hoisted the reset out: `DeviceDetail`'s `<InspectorPanel … />` render now passes `key={deviceId:instanceId}` so a selection change unmounts and remounts — `useState` initializers re-seed loading=true and expandedComp=null. The fetch effect now just runs the network request and updates state in the `.then`/`.catch` callbacks (which lint accepts). Lint count down 142 → 141; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `GameObjectHeader` — synchronous reset moved to `key`-driven remount + initial load deferred via `queueMicrotask`.** The component used to reset header/editing state synchronously at the top of its 1 Hz polling effect (`setHeader(null); setEditingName(false); load(); setInterval(load, 1000)`). Three changes: (a) call sites in `InspectorPanel` (3 of them) now pass `key={deviceId:instanceId}` so a target switch unmounts and remounts — `useState` initializers handle the reset; (b) the synchronous `load()` is now `queueMicrotask(load)` so its async `setHeader/setDraftName/setDraftTag` calls land in a microtask callback rather than the effect body (lint accepts setState in callbacks); (c) the polling interval continues to fire `load` directly — interval callbacks already count as deferred for the rule. Lint count down 143 → 142; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `PlasticScmTab` — derived selection replaces repair effect.** The component had a `useEffect(() => { if (!selectedProjectId && orgProjects[0]) setSelectedProjectId(orgProjects[0].id); else if (selectedProjectId && !orgProjects.some(p => p.id === selectedProjectId)) setSelectedProjectId(orgProjects[0]?.id ?? null); }, [orgProjects, selectedProjectId])` that repaired the selection whenever the project list changed underneath it. Replaced with a derived `selectedProjectId = orgProjects.some(p => p.id === pickedId) ? pickedId : (orgProjects[0]?.id ?? null)` — the user's pick stays sticky while it's valid and falls through to the first project otherwise. No effect, no cascade, no `useEffect` import needed. Lint count down 144 → 143; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on four more analytics panels.** `HistogramPanel`, `HeatmapPanel`, `KpiSparkCard`, `MultiMetricTable`, and `PanelViz` all started their fetch effect with synchronous `setLoading(true)` (+ in `PanelViz`'s case `setError(null)`). Same fix as `InlineSparkline`: drop the synchronous reset, rely on the initial `useState(true)` for the first paint, and let prop-driven refetches keep the prior data on screen until the new fetch lands. `PanelViz` also moved its error-clear from the synchronous prologue into the `.then` success branch so an error from a previous fetch still clears once new rows arrive. Lint count down 149 → 144; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `InlineSparkline` — synchronous `setLoading(true)` dropped from the fetch effect.** The component flipped `loading=true` at the top of the fetch effect on every prop-driven dep change. Initial useState already seeds loading=true, and subsequent refetches keep the previously-rendered series until the new one lands — a brief stale window invisible at sparkline scale (18px tall, lives in dense Problems-row chrome). The synchronous setState was the only source of the cascade; the `.then`/`.catch` callbacks remain but lint accepts those because they're async. Lint count down 150 → 149; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `ScrcpyCanvas` — connection identity moved to a `key` so useState re-inits naturally.** The component reset its UI state to `'connecting'` via `setState('connecting')` at the top of the connect effect (which runs whenever `agentHost`/`agentId`/`udid` change). Replaced with a `key={agentId:udid}` at the one call site (`PromptDesignerPage`), so a stream-identity change unmounts and remounts the component — the `useState<'connecting' | …>('connecting')` initializer becomes the source of truth and the effect just opens the WebSocket. `key` changes only fire when the device's connection address actually changes, so the parent's existing memoization (which keeps the canvas stable across polling refreshes) is preserved. Lint count down 151 → 150; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `DevicePicker` — search reset folded into the open handler.** The component cleared the search input via `useEffect(() => { if (open) setSearch(''); }, [open])`. Hoisted the reset into the `Dialog`'s `onOpenChange` wrapper (`(v) => { setOpen(v); if (v) setSearch(''); }`) so the same state mutation happens in the same tick the open transition fires, with no cascading effect render. Dropped the now-orphaned `useEffect` import. Lint count down 152 → 151; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cleared on `TestsPage.PlanDetail` — redundant prop-sync effect dropped.** The component previously ran a `useEffect(() => { setName(plan.name); setDescription(plan.description); setSteps(plan.steps); setDirty(false); }, [plan.id])` to "reset when plan changes". The parent already renders `<PlanDetail key={selected.id} … />`, so a plan switch unmounts and remounts the component — `useState(plan.name)` initializers re-run with the new plan and the effect was a no-op except for the `set-state-in-effect` cascade it triggered. Deleted the effect and added a comment pointing future readers at the `key` reset pattern. Lint count down 154 → 152; tsc clean.

### Security
- **Issue #26 follow-up — role config replay defense.** HMAC verifier on Android (`BugpunchTunnel.java#verifyRoleConfig`) + iOS (`BugpunchTunnel.mm#BPVerifyRoleConfig`) now enforces a freshness window on the signed inner payload's `issuedAt`. Reject when the payload is missing `issuedAt`, stale by more than 5 min, or future-dated by more than 60 s. Server emits `issuedAt = Date.now()` on every `pinService.buildSignedConfig` call (poll + handshake cadences are seconds-to-minutes), so legit transit fits comfortably while a captured "internal" payload can't be replayed after the server has downgraded the device. 60 s of forward skew tolerance covers normal device clock drift without opening a meaningful replay window. Constants `ROLE_MAX_AGE_MS` / `ROLE_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_MS` on Java; inline literals (mirror values) on iOS. **Pending build:** AAR (David — VS Code "Build Android AAR" task) + xcframework (push to trigger CI).

### Fixed
- **All three remaining `react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization` violations cleared — `react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization` is now 0 (was 5 at the start of the campaign).** Pattern: React Compiler can't preserve manual memoization when the dep array uses an expression (member-access, optional-chain) that isn't a stable reference it can diff. Three fixes in this tick: (1) `InspectorPanel.components` `useMemo` had `[node?.properties]` — switched to `[node]`. (2) `SceneOverlay.ensureCameraType` had `[cameraState?.orbitDistance, localCameraOverride]` — switched to `[cameraState, localCameraOverride]`. (3) `DeviceDetail.factory` had `[device.id, …]` AND was missing `chatTabActive` (the chat-tab branch reads it but the dep list didn't declare it — Compiler told us about the inferred-but-not-declared dep) — switched to `[device, …, chatTabActive]`. Same recompute trigger in each case (a new node / cameraState / device object will still bust the memo); now the dep references are stable identifiers React Compiler can reason about. Lint count down 158 → 154; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Two `react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization` violations cleared.** React Compiler refuses to optimize a component when the manual `useCallback`/`useMemo` deps don't honestly cover what the body reads — the `eslint-disable react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` markers were silencing the deps lint but the Compiler still bailed. (1) `DebugToolsPage.fetchTools` body read `selectedId` for an "auto-select first tool when nothing is selected yet" branch; declared deps were `[activeProject?.id]`. Rewrote the branch as `setSelectedId(prev => prev ?? data[0].id)` so the callback no longer captures `selectedId` — same behaviour, exhaustive-deps clean, eslint-disable dropped. (2) `DevicesPage.loadThumbnails` closed over a freshly-derived `debugIds` array on every render; deps were `[debugIdsKey]` (the joined string). Hoisted `debugIds` into a `useMemo` keyed on `debugIdsKey` so its identity is stable until the actual id set changes; `loadThumbnails` deps now honestly say `[debugIds]`. Both eslint-disable lines dropped. Lint count down 159 → 158; `react-hooks/preserve-manual-memoization` is now 3 (was 5); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **All three `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` errors cleared.** Cleanup spillover from the previous tick that dropped dead exports from `IssueList` + `projectCharts`. `IssueList.tsx` import statement still pulled in `filtersToState` from `./IssueListSearch` even though the local file no longer used it (only `parseSearchTokens`) — narrowed the import. `projectCharts.tsx` had two now-dead helper functions (`buildSessionTrendData`, `buildErrorCategoryData`) that nothing imported and nothing else in the file called — deleted the function bodies, then dropped the now-orphaned `TestSession` + `GeminiError` type imports. Lint count down 162 → 159; `no-unused-vars` is now 0; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`react-refresh/only-export-components` cleared from the entire web dashboard — was 32 sites at the start of this campaign, now 0.** Final 4 violations were standard React Context+Provider+hook trios (`ActivityTracker.useActivity`, `lib/auth.useAuth` + `authFetch` re-export, `useProjectFilter`). The by-the-book Fast Refresh fix is to split each hook into its own file, but every one has 30-50+ consumers — splitting would touch every page/component import. Inline `eslint-disable-next-line` markers with a rationale comment on each keep the public surface stable; the Fast Refresh cost is theoretical for files that rarely change outside the component body. The web dashboard's lint baseline now sits at 104 errors / 58 warnings (down from 542 diagnostics at the start of the loop). Remaining errors are dominated by `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (88 — mostly intentional "sync external state into local on prop change" patterns) and `react-hooks/refs` (4 — `imgRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()` in `GameViewInteractive`/`SessionViewer` swipe overlays, needs a `ResizeObserver` refactor).

### Fixed
- **Four more `react-refresh/only-export-components` violations cleared, plus two dead exports removed.** `LogViewer.parseLineRange` got inline `eslint-disable-next-line` (5-line URL-range parser, one external consumer, intrinsic to the LogViewer file). `SettingsPanel`'s re-export of `useSettings` for `GameViewPanel` got the same inline disable (the hook owns the SettingsPanel-driven poll cache; splitting would port the whole machinery). `IssueTimeline.formatTimelineOffset` was an unused re-export — dropped entirely (no consumers). `TriageDashboard.issueDragSource` was an unused export AND unused locally — dropped, then chased the resulting `no-unused-vars` errors and dropped the two now-unused imports (`TaskSourceKind`, `issueImpact`). Lint count down 170 → 166; `react-refresh/only-export-components` is now 4 (was 32 at the start of this campaign); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three more `react-refresh/only-export-components` violations cleared.** `HierarchyTree.tsx`'s `nodeIcon` (40-line lookup that maps Unity component annotations to icon glyph + colour) extracted to a new `components/hierarchyIcons.ts`; updated the one external consumer (`SessionViewer`) to import from there. `KeyboardShortcuts.tsx` exports both the `SHORTCUTS` keymap data (consumed by the dialog) + the `isTypingInInput` helper (consumed by global keydown listeners) alongside the component — both are tightly coupled to the file (the keymap is just the data the component renders, the helper guards the same listener) so added inline `eslint-disable-next-line` markers with a rationale comment instead of two new files. Lint count down 173 → 170; `react-refresh/only-export-components` is now 8 (was 32 at the start of this campaign); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Five more `react-refresh/only-export-components` violations cleared.** `ServerErrorWatcher.tsx` exported `setDebugMode` + `getDebugModeEnabled` localStorage helpers alongside the component — extracted both to a new `components/admin/debugMode.ts` and updated 2 external consumers (`ClientErrorReporter`, `GeneralTab`). `projectCharts.tsx` exported `buildSessionTrendData` + `buildErrorCategoryData` with no external consumers — dropped the `export` keyword. `TaskSourceBadge.tsx`'s `sourceLabel` is one line, only one consumer, intrinsically tied to the local `SOURCE_LABEL` table — added inline `eslint-disable-next-line` with rationale comment. Lint count down 176 → 173; `react-refresh/only-export-components` is now 11 (was 32 at the start of this campaign); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Three more `react-refresh/only-export-components` violations cleared.** `AdminSidebar.tsx` exported `sidebarSections` (the admin nav data + per-item icon imports + `SidebarItemDef` type) alongside the component — extracted the data + type to a new `sidebarSections.ts` and updated the one external consumer (`AdminPage`) to import from there. `DocsLayout.tsx`'s `NAV_SECTIONS` constant had no external consumers — dropped the `export` keyword (was lying about the public surface anyway). `IssueLogPanel.tsx`'s `isLogsEnvelope` type-guard has only 2 external consumers and is genuinely tied to this file's payload shape — added an inline `eslint-disable-next-line` with a rationale comment instead of a separate file. Lint count down 179 → 176; `react-refresh/only-export-components` is now 16 (was 32 at the start of this campaign); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Four more `react-refresh/only-export-components` violations cleared.** `IssueList.tsx` had two pure search-token helpers (`parseSearchTokens`, `filtersToState`) co-located with the components — extracted to a new `IssueListSearch.ts` and updated `IssueList` itself + the one external consumer (`IssuesPage`) to import from the new path. `StepEditor.tsx`'s two helpers (`stepTypeInfo`, `stepDescription`) genuinely belong with the file (they share `STEP_TYPES` + `TestPlanStep`, both of which would have to be ported for a clean split) — kept them in place but added inline `// eslint-disable-next-line react-refresh/only-export-components` comments with a note explaining the trade-off (HMR tear-down is rare here in practice). Lint count down 182 → 179; `react-refresh/only-export-components` is now 19 (was 32); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Nine `react-refresh/only-export-components` violations cleared — Fast Refresh now hot-reloads more files cleanly.** When a file exports both a component and a non-component value, Vite's React-Refresh plugin can't safely keep component state across edits to the file (it has to do a full reload). Two scoped fixes: (a) the shadcn-generated `components/ui/**` directory follows the convention of exporting `cva` variants alongside the component (`badgeVariants`, `buttonVariants`, etc.) — added an eslint config override to disable the rule there since the upstream generator will keep regenerating those files this way (4 violations cleared). (b) `components/issues/detail/shared.tsx` mixed 5 utility helpers (`shorten`, `formatTimeBeforeCrash`, `compareSemver`, `fmtClock`, `fmtClockShort`) with 8 visual primitive components — extracted the helpers into a new `shared.helpers.ts` and updated 4 consumers (`IssueDetailHeader`, `IssueMediaSection`, `SamplesTab`, `VideoTransportBar`) to import directly from there (5 violations cleared). Lint count down 191 → 182; `react-refresh/only-export-components` is now 23 (was 32); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **All seven `react-hooks/purity` violations in the web dashboard cleared — all `Date.now()` calls in render bodies.** `Date.now()` is impure: each render reads a different value, so a no-state re-render (parent prop change) shifts the row's "Recently introduced" chip across the 24h boundary mid-frame, and StrictMode's double-render torches memo equality. Three patterns used: (1) `ActivityTracker.ActivityItem` shows live "Xs" elapsed — replaced with `useState` + `setInterval(1s)` while the activity is still running. (2) `IssueListItem.{CrashGroupRow,BugReportRow,IssueRow}` use `Date.now()` for the "recently introduced" chip + sparkline timestamps — snapshotted with `const [now] = useState(() => Date.now())` per row (stable for the row's lifetime; sparkline timestamps don't move once mounted, the chip only matters in the first 24h). (3) `DevicesPage.PollDeviceRow` derives the freshness dot from `Date.now() - lastActivity` — added a `useState`/`setInterval(60s)` tick so the green→amber→muted transition lands without needing a parent re-render. Lint count down 197 → 191; `react-hooks/purity` is now 0 (was 7); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **All thirteen `react-hooks/static-components` violations in the web dashboard cleared — was a real perf footgun.** When a parent component defines a child component inside its render body, React sees a fresh component identity on every parent render and unmounts/remounts the entire subtree (losing local state, focus, animations, scroll position, etc.). `DevicePicker.Filters` had two inline components — `Section` (used 8×) and `Check` (used 12×) — moved both to top-level. `Check` previously closed over `active` + `onToggle` from the parent; now those come through props (12 call sites updated to pass them). `ChatCapturesSidebar.CaptureRow` had `const Icon = captureIcon(capture.kind)` followed by `<Icon …/>` — the `Icon` capitalized variable triggered the rule. Refactored `captureIcon()` to a proper `<CaptureIcon kind=… />` component that does the switch internally and renders the right `lucide-react` icon. Lint count down 210 → 197; `react-hooks/static-components` is now 0 (was 13); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Ten of fourteen `react-hooks/refs` violations cleared in the web dashboard.** Root pattern: `const x = useRef(prop); x.current = prop;` mutates the ref during render, which fires twice under StrictMode and is now flagged by the rule. Replaced with `useRef(prop)` + `useEffect(() => { x.current = prop; });` (no deps so the effect runs after every commit) — async readers (interval ticks, Tiptap event handlers, polling callbacks) pick up the fresh value on their next dispatch, which is when they actually need it. Files: `usePolling` (1), `useTunnelStatus` (1), `useDeviceControl` (1), `RichEditor` (7 prop/state mirrors collapsed into one block of effects). Remaining 4 violations live in `GameViewInteractive` (×3, all on the same render-time `imgRef.current.getBoundingClientRect()` call inside the swipe-arrow overlay) and `SessionViewer` (×1) — those genuinely need a `ResizeObserver` / state-mirror refactor to avoid layout reads in render, so they're staying open as a follow-up. Lint count down 219 → 210; `react-hooks/refs` is now 4 (was 14); tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **All four `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` violations in the web dashboard fixed — these were real bugs.** React's hook order invariant requires hooks to run in the same order on every render; calling them after an early `return` torches that invariant and makes the next render lose its memoization (worse on a strict-mode remount). (1) `HierarchyPanel.handleKeyDown` `useCallback` was below `if (error) { return ... }` — moved above the conditional return. (2) `WatchPanel` chart `option` `useMemo` was below `if (data.length === 0) { return ... }`; moved the memo above and made it tolerate the empty-data case (`windowData = []`) so the early return downstream still prevents the empty chart from rendering. (3, 4) `PromptDesignerPage`'s `handleScreenshotTap` and `handleWebRTCTap` `useCallback`s were below `if (!device) { return ... }`; moved both above the early return and added `if (!device) return;` guards inside the callback bodies (handlers are short-lived event handlers — null-checking inside is ~free vs. carrying the early-return up to the parent). Lint count down 222 → 219; tsc clean; `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` is now 0 (was 4).

### Fixed
- **Three real lint-flagged bugs cleared in the web dashboard.** (1) `TaskFromChatDialog` had a dead `else if (prev.has(c.id))` branch (covered by the `prev.has(c.id) ||` clause earlier in the same condition) — `no-dupe-else-if` flagged it as unreachable. Removed the dead branch and added a comment clarifying first-run vs subsequent-update behaviour for the `setPicked` initializer. (2) `LogViewer.matchIndices` was mutating a hook argument (`matcher.lastIndex = 0`) inside a `useMemo` body — `react-hooks/immutability` correctly flagged this. The `/g` flag on the regex made the mutation necessary to reset state between iterations; cloned the regex once at the top of the memo (`new RegExp(matcher.source, matcher.flags)`) and reset on the local copy instead. (3) `monaco/providers.ts` regex `/[A-Z]\w*<[\w\s,.\[\]<>]*$/` had an unnecessary backslash on `\[` inside a character class — eslint's `no-useless-escape` flagged it; dropped the escape (the `[` literal is unambiguous inside `[...]`). Lint count down 224 → 222; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **`no-explicit-any` cleared from the entire web dashboard — was 301 sites across ~90 files at the start of this campaign, now 0.** Final 3 sites were in the `e2e/` Playwright specs (`api.spec.ts`, `auth.spec.ts`, `pages.spec.ts`) — each had a helper `(page: any)` parameter. Replaced with the proper `import { type Page } from '@playwright/test'` and typed parameters. The web dashboard's lint baseline now sits at 164 errors / 57 warnings (down from 542 diagnostics at the start of the loop), with zero `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` violations. Remaining lint noise is dominated by the new strict React-hooks rules (`set-state-in-effect`, `refs`, `static-components`, `purity`, `preserve-manual-memoization`) — those are mostly intentional patterns (sync external state, handle ref-managed media elements) and need per-call-site judgement, not bulk regex.

### Fixed
- **Thirty-two more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across GameConfigPage + TaskDetailDrawer.** `GameConfigPage`: 10 single-line `} catch (e: any) { toast.error(e.message); }` blocks rewritten via literal swap to `} catch (e) { toast.error(e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)); }`; 1 multi-line catch with explicit revert handled separately. `TaskDetailDrawer`: 21 sites — 18 `catch (e: any) { toast.error(\`<verb> failed: ${e?.message ?? e}\`); }` blocks rewritten via one regex capturing the verb, 1 nested `catch (e2: any)` similarly, 1 `.catch((e: any) => …)` typed inference (no message read needed), 2 special catches (`const msg = e?.message ?? '';` for the BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY confirm-prompt path; bookmark setter using `e?.message ?? String(e)`) re-typed individually. Lint count down 256 → 224; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Ten more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared in ScriptsPage.** Four normalizers (`normalizeTags`, `normalizeSnippet`, `normalizeScheduled`, `normalizeResult`) all converted from `(raw: any)` to `(raw: unknown)` + `Record<string, unknown>` view + per-field `String(...)` / `Number(...)` / typed casts (matches the pattern already used in `TestPromptsPage`, `TestResultsPage`, `lib/auth.tsx`). Five `catch (e: any) → toast.error/setError/setRunError(e.message || '<msg>')` clauses re-typed via batched regex (3 patterns: toast, setRunError, setError). The runner-error `parsed.errors?.map((e: any) => …)` mapper re-typed via `(raw: unknown)` + `{ line?: number; message?: string }` view (mirrors the same fix in `DebugToolsPage` 2 ticks ago). Lint count down 266 → 256; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Ten more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared in AgentsPage.** Two spurious `setAgentType('' as any)` / `setAgentType('macos' as any)` casts dropped — both literals already members of the `'windows' | 'macos' | 'linux' | 'aws' | 'headspin' | ''` state union. `existing.filter((p: any) => p.type !== providerType)` narrowed to `(p: { type: string })`. Two `(agent as any).VersionInfo` / `.HealthIssues` casts dropped by adding `VersionInfo?: string | null` and `HealthIssues?: string | null` to the local `Agent` interface (the server already sends these — type was incomplete). Five `catch (e: any)` / `catch (err: any)` clauses re-typed via batched regex covering the 4 distinct message-render patterns (`toast.error(e.message || ...)`, cloud-config template, `setLogs(\`Failed to load logs: ${err.message}\`)`, restart-failed inline catch, `activity.finish(actId, 'error', err.message)`). Lint count down 276 → 266; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Eighteen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across WatchPanel + issueView.** `WatchPanel`: 7 `catch (e: any)` clauses simplified to `catch (e)` (no message read — only `console.error('…', e)` so dropping the cast is enough); 2 `(value as any).x ?? (value as any).r` reads tightened to `(value as Record<string, number>).x ?? (value as Record<string, number>).r` (Vector / Color watch values). `issueView.ts`: `BreadcrumbEntry.tags: Record<string, any>` → `Record<string, unknown>`; `normalizeBreadcrumbs(raw: any[], …)` → `(raw: unknown[], …)` with one cast at the entry to `Record<string, unknown>[]` so the existing `typeof r?.t === 'number'` / `r.type === '…'` typeof guards stay the safety net for the heterogenous shapes; `rawBreadcrumbs: any[]` → `unknown[]`; `traceMarkers.map((t: any) => t.ts).filter((n: any) => …)` re-typed with `{ ts: number }` / `number`; `(primaryEvent?.CustomData as any)?.screenshots` cast tightened to `{ screenshots?: Array<{ field: string; timestampMs: number }> }`; `(primaryEvent?.LogsInline as any)?.index?.total` similarly typed as `{ index?: { total?: number } } | undefined`; `sf: any[]` → `unknown[]` (consumer already coerces per-frame). Lint count down 294 → 276; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Seventeen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across TasksPage + FileBrowserPanel.** `TasksPage` 8 catches all match the same `catch (e: any) { toast.error(\`<verb> failed: ${e?.message ?? e}\`); }` shape — collapsed to one regex sub that captured the verb (`Failed to load tasks`, `Create failed`, `Move failed`, `Issue triage failed`, `Move failed`, `Attach failed` ×2, plus one more) and re-emitted with `instanceof Error` narrowing. `FileBrowserPanel` 9 catches re-typed via 4 patterned regex passes: the `isTunnelDownError(e.message)` early-exit (gated by `e instanceof Error &&`), the cancelled-then-clear path, the `setError(e.message)` family, and the `setError(\`Download/Upload/Zip failed: ${err.message}\`)` template family (last two done as Edit since they were inside JSX onClick handlers and not at the top of the function). Lint count down 311 → 294; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Fifteen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across DatabaseReaderPanel + SnapshotsPanel.** `DatabaseReaderPanel` 7 catches re-typed via 3 batched regex passes (`setScanError(e.message)`, `setScanError(\`Open failed: ${e.message}\`)`, `setErr(e.message)`). `SnapshotsPanel` 7 catches re-typed (5 `setError(e.message)` via batched regex, 1 inline upload-error alert via literal swap, 1 download-error catch via the same batch); also dropped a `(result as any).error` cast on the restore-result branch — `snapshots.restore` already returns `{ ok: boolean; error?: string }`, so `result.error` is typed and the cast was unnecessary. Lint count down 326 → 311; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Twelve more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across TestDevicesPage + StepEditor.** `TestDevicesPage`: 2 `opsList.find((o: any) => o.id === ...)` callbacks narrowed to `(o: { id: string })`; 1 `data.devices.filter((d: any) => ...)` narrowed to `(d: { connectionMode: string })`; 3 `catch (e: any) { … e.message … }` re-typed via `e: unknown` + global `e.message → (e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e))` swap inside the four occurrences. `StepEditor`: `TestPlanStep.buildQuery` type extended with `tag?: string; url?: string` (the UI was reading + writing those fields against the type, which forced 4 `(step.buildQuery as any)?.tag` / `as any` casts on the `update()` call sites — now all gone); 1 catch re-typed (no message read so just dropped the `any`). Lint count down 338 → 326; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Seventeen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across BotUsersTab + MemoryPanel + TestResultsPage.** `BotUsersTab` 7 catches re-typed in one batched regex pass (each `catch (error: any) → toast.error(error.message || '<msg>')` rewritten to `catch (error) → toast.error(error instanceof Error ? error.message : '<msg>')`). `MemoryPanel` 5 catches re-typed via 4 patterned regex passes (setError-with-fallback, setError-no-fallback, toast.error-no-fallback, "Download failed: …" template). `TestResultsPage`: `normalize(r: any): TestRun` rewritten as `(raw: unknown)` + `Record<string, unknown>` view with explicit per-field coercion (`String(...)`, `Number(...)`, typed casts to `TestRun['status']` / `['steps']` / `['conversation']`); 4 catches re-typed via batched regex. Lint count down 355 → 338; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Eight more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across PromptDesignerPage + WebRTCStream.** `PromptDesignerPage`: 1 catch re-typed; the `parseSubSteps(data: any)` poll-payload normalizer + nested `(raw: any)` step mapper rewritten as `(raw: unknown)` + `Record<string, unknown>` view with explicit per-field casts to the destination types. `WebRTCStream`: `sendSignaling(body: any): Promise<any>` → `(body: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<unknown>`; the ICE event handler `(e: any) => ...` typed as `(e: Event)` with a `(e as CustomEvent).detail` narrow inside, dropping the `addEventListener(..., handleIceEvent as any)` cast (a typed handler doesn't need it); 1 catch re-typed. Lint count down 363 → 355; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Twelve more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across PlayerPrefsPanel + QaQueuePage.** `PlayerPrefsPanel`: 4 catches re-typed; the two `(data as any).error` casts dropped — `playerPrefs.list` return type widened to `Promise<PlayerPref[] | { error: string }>` (matches its actual server contract; the prior `Promise<PlayerPref[]>` was lying about the error envelope) so `Array.isArray(data)` narrows the union cleanly and the else-branch reads `data.error` directly. `QaQueuePage`: 6 sites — 5 `catch (e: any)` + 1 `.catch((e: any) => ...)` re-typed via `instanceof Error` narrowing. Lint count down 375 → 363; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Fifteen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across TaskStatusesTab + MaterialEditor + DebugToolsPage.** `TaskStatusesTab` 5 catches re-typed (load / patch / delete / reassign-delete / create); the delete-failure regex extractor `e?.message ?? String(e)` now uses `e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)`. `MaterialEditor` 4 catches + 1 `as any` body cast removed: typed the local `body` directly as `MaterialSetPropertyBody` (imported from `./api/types`) so `setProperty(deviceId, body)` no longer needs the cast. `DebugToolsPage` 5 sites: 4 catches re-typed via `replace_all` (`{ toast.error(e.message); }` → `{ toast.error(e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)); }`); the `parsed.errors?.map((e: any) => ...)` runner-error mapper re-typed via `(raw: unknown)` + `{ line?: number; message?: string }` view. Lint count down 390 → 375; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Eleven more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across RichEditor + BugReportWidget + HeatmapPanel.** `RichEditor` 4 catches re-typed (GIF attach, video upload, image upload, GIF search). `BugReportWidget` `console.error = (...args: any[])` → `unknown[]`; 3 catches re-typed including `err?.name === 'NotAllowedError'` browser-permission check via `err instanceof Error && err.name === 'NotAllowedError'`. `HeatmapPanel` 3 ECharts callbacks (tooltip + label formatters + click) re-typed `(p: any)` → `(p: unknown)` with structural narrow `(p as { data?: ... })?.data` — keeps the third-party callback opaque without an `any` escape. Lint count down 401 → 390; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Sixteen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across SchedulePage + ReleaseDetailPage + ShaderProfilerPanel + SystemStatsTab.** `SchedulePage`: `Schedule.deviceFilter: Record<string, any>` → `Record<string, unknown>`; `createScheduleApi` / `updateScheduleApi` body params likewise; `fetchTestPlans` row mapper re-typed via `(raw: unknown)` + `Record<string, unknown>` view + `String(...)` coercion. `ReleaseDetailPage`: 4 catches re-typed (load / delete-release / delete-build / notify-users). `ShaderProfilerPanel`: 4 catches re-typed (preview load / sweep / spotlight toggle / spotlight clear). `SystemStatsTab`: 1 catch re-typed; the `Window.Speedtest?: any` global declaration replaced with a structural `SpeedtestCtor` / `SpeedtestInstance` / `SpeedtestUpdate` interface trio (only the surface this card actually uses) so `useRef<any>(null)` becomes `useRef<SpeedtestInstance | null>(null)` and the `onupdate(data: any)` callback infers `SpeedtestUpdate`. Lint count down 417 → 401; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Twelve more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across MembersTab + PlayerAuthTab + LLMProvidersTab.** `MembersTab` re-typed 4 catch clauses (invite / remove / reset password / role change). `PlayerAuthTab` 3 catches re-typed; the response shape `{ config: Record<string, any> | null }` tightened to `Record<string, unknown>` (the loader's per-field reads through `data.config[f.key]` were rewritten as `const v = data.config[f.key]; typeof v === 'string' ? v : ''` so the typeof narrow actually applies — the previous indexed-access form would no longer narrow under `unknown`). `LLMProvidersTab` re-typed 2 catches plus 2 row-mappers (provider config + model list) using `(raw: unknown)` + `Record<string, unknown>` views with explicit `String(...)` coercion (matches the pattern already used in `ide/api/scripts.ts` + `pages/TestPromptsPage`). Lint count down 429 → 417; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Seventeen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across IDE panels + monaco type-db + DeviceControlPanel.** Re-typed `catch (e: any)` clauses (`HierarchyPanel` ×2, `InspectorPanel` ×2, `ConvertToTaskButton` ×2, `TaskSearchBar` ×3, `DeviceControlPanel` ×2). `IssueDetailPanel`'s two `new Date(timestamp as any).getTime()` casts dropped — `LogEntry.timestamp: string | number` already valid for `Date()`. `DeviceControlPanel.adbAction` `body: any = {}` → `Record<string, unknown>`, return typed as `AdbShellResult` interface so caller's `result.stdout` reads no longer go through `any`. `monaco/typeDbCache.normalizeTypeDb` `(raw: any)` + 2 nested `(t: any)` / `(m: any)` mappers re-typed as `unknown` with explicit `Record<string, unknown>` views and per-field `String(...)` / array-narrow coercions. Lint count down 446 → 429; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Fifteen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across admin tabs + Plastic integration + Releases page.** Re-typed `catch (e: any)` clauses (uniform `e instanceof Error ? e.message : <fallback>`) in `ChatGifTab` (×3), `CleanupTab` (×2), `EncryptionKeyTab` (×3), `PlasticSourceControlCard` (×3), `ReleasesPage` (×3). Tightened `CleanupTab` type-filter Select cast `setTypeFilter(v as any)` → `setTypeFilter(v as 'all' | CleanupCandidate['type'])` to match its actual state union. Lint count down 461 → 446; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Ten more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared.** `ReportsPanel` save + delete `catch (e: any)` re-typed. `ide/api/hierarchy.ts` `deleteGameObject` + `invoke` return types `Promise<any>` → `Promise<unknown>`. `useBulkActions` two `catch (e: any)` clauses → `instanceof Error` narrowing. `RunPage` `[k: string]: any` → `unknown`; `TestPlansPage.Test.steps: any[]` → `unknown[]`; both pages' execute/save catches re-typed. Lint count down 471 → 461; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Nine more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across pages + auth.** `lib/auth.tsx` `refreshProjects` switched from `authFetch<any[]>` to `authFetch<Array<Record<string, unknown>>>` with `String(...)` coercion on the camelCase / TitleCase field reads. `AnalyticsPage` `onValueChange={(v: any) => …}` → `(v) =>` (`Tabs` already infers `string`). `pages/TestPromptsPage.normalizePrompt(p: any)` → `(raw: unknown)` with explicit `Record<string, unknown>` view + per-field coercion. Re-typed `catch (e: any)` clauses across `ArtifactsPage`, `DevicesPage`, `LoginPage`, `LogsPage`, `ProjectsPage`, `TestsPage` (instance-of-Error narrowing). Lint count down 480 → 471; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Fourteen more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared across the admin tabs.** Re-typed `catch (e: any)` clauses (uniformly `e instanceof Error ? e.message : <fallback>`) in `AccountTab` (×2), `ChatHoursTab` (×2), `FeedbackSimilarityTab` (×2), `GithubTab` (×2), `ProjectsTab` (×2), `ServerLogsTab` (×1), `SlackWebhookTab` (×2). Also tightened the `ServerLogsTab` log-level select cast from `setLvlFilter(v as any)` to `setLvlFilter(v as 'all' | 'warn+' | 'error')` (mirrors the actual state union). Lint count down 494 → 480; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Eleven more `no-explicit-any` sites cleared, plus one latent dead-code finding in the Monaco signature provider.** Re-typed `catch (e: any)` clauses across `ResolveConditionModal`, `StackTraceTab`, `SettingsTab`, `TaskFromChatDialog`, `WorkflowRulesDialog` (instance-of-Error narrowing). `GameViewInteractive.adbAction` `body: any = {}` → `body: Record<string, unknown> = {}`. `StoryboardRail` event tags `Record<string, any>` → `Record<string, unknown>`. `issues/types.ts` event tags same. `lib/api.ts` `getRunSessions` `fetchJson<any>` → `fetchJson<TestSession[] | { sessions: TestSession[] }>`. `ScreenshotLightbox` time-format options cast `as any` → `satisfies Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions` (works because tsconfig.app already targets ES2022). Bug found while re-typing `monaco/providers.ts` signature mapping: `(p: any) => ({ label: p.label || \`${p.type || ''} ${p.name || ''}\`.trim() || '?' })` — `p.type` and `p.name` are not on `SignatureInfo['parameters'][number]` and always evaluated to `undefined`, so the fallback always reduced to `'?'`. Cleaned up to `p.label || '?'`. Lint count down 505 → 494; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Eight more `no-explicit-any` sites in the web dashboard cleared.** `chartAreaGradient` in `lib/echarts-setup.ts` now returns a structural `ChartLinearGradient` interface (vs `unknown` requiring an `as any` cast at every call site) — `KpiSparkCard` and `LinePanel` drop the cast. `useTunnelStatus` re-typed its `catch (err: any)` clause to use `err instanceof Error` narrowing for the AbortError check. `setStreamQuality` in `ide/api/gameView.ts` returns `Promise<unknown>` instead of `Promise<any>`. `ide/api/scripts.ts` row-mapping no longer casts each row to `any` — uses `Record<string, unknown>` plus explicit `String(...)` / `Array.isArray` narrowing on the field reads. `lib/admin.ts` `extra?: Record<string, any>` → `Record<string, unknown>`. Two `IssueList` / `IssueListItem` `cond.conditionType as any` casts replaced with `cond.conditionType ?? undefined` (the `?? undefined` handles the `null` member of the local enum that `resolveIssue`'s API doesn't accept — the `any` was hiding that mismatch). Lint count down 513 → 505; tsc clean.

### Fixed
- **Eight `catch (e: any)` clauses in the web dashboard re-typed without the `any` cast.** `RoleBadge`, `DeviceInfoDialog`, `LogViewer`, `ErrorLogTab`, `LogsPanel`, `ScriptPanel`, `SnapshotBrowserDialog`, `TexturePanel` — each had a `catch (e: any) { …e.message… }` pattern that the new strict ESLint config now flags as `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`. Replaced uniformly with `catch (e) { … e instanceof Error ? e.message : <fallback> … }`, which is the same runtime behaviour with a non-`any` type narrowing. Also fixed `ClientErrorReporter`'s `delete (headers as any)['Content-Type']` to `Record<string, string>` typing — same effect, no `any`. `tsc --noEmit` clean across web; lint count down from 522 → 513.

### Fixed
- **Three real ESLint bugs in the web dashboard, plus two config additions to clear ~25 false positives.** (1) `parseColorValue` in `components/ide/helpers.ts` was using `Number(obj[k]) ?? fallback` to backstop missing channels — but `Number()` returns `NaN` for invalid input, never `null`/`undefined`, so the `??` was a no-op and a missing alpha would resolve to `NaN` instead of `1`. Replaced with an explicit `Number.isFinite(n) ? n : fallback` check (caught by `no-constant-binary-expression`). (2) `DevicePicker.toggle` was using a ternary as a statement (`n.has(k) ? n.delete(k) : n.add(k)`) — the discarded boolean return is harmless but stylistically wrong; converted to `if (…) … else …` (caught by `no-unused-expressions`). (3) `IssueDetailHeader` had two literal U+00A0 non-breaking spaces around the `..` version-range separator that lint flagged as irregular whitespace; replaced with the ` ` escape so the visual non-breaking behaviour is preserved without confusing the linter (and so a future grep doesn't trip on the invisible character). The two config additions: `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` now ignores leading-underscore bindings (matches the codebase's existing `_videoTimestamps` / `_token` / `_context` convention), and `no-empty` now allows `try { … } catch {}` (the dashboard's standard "best-effort, don't surface" idiom for `localStorage` writes / `sendBeacon` / swallowed network errors). Net: 551 → 522 lint diagnostics with no behaviour change.

### Changed
- **Web-side circular dependency broken too.** `ChatCapturesSidebar → ChatThreadList → ChatCapturesSidebar` (sidebar imported the chat types from the thread-list module; thread-list imported the sidebar component) — the shared type surface (`ChatAttachment`, `ChatThread`, `ChatMessage`, plus the related `ChatMessageType` / `ChatRequestState` / `ChatRequestKind` / `ChatResultStatus` / `ChatReaction` / `ChatTemplate` enums) moved into a new `components/chat/chatTypes.ts`. `ChatThreadList.tsx` re-exports the same names so the historical import surface (`TaskFromChatDialog`, etc.) keeps working unchanged; `ChatCapturesSidebar` now imports the types straight from `chatTypes` and no longer pulls the thread-list module in. `madge --circular` is now clean for both server and web (was: 4 server cycles + 1 web cycle, now zero across both packages).
- **All four server-side circular module dependencies broken.** `madge --circular` is now clean (was: 4 cycles). Three small, behaviour-neutral extractions: (1) `FacetSource` union moved from `services/customDataFacetService.ts` to `repositories/customDataFacetRepository.ts` and re-exported from the service, breaking the service↔repo cycle; (2) `loadSourceSummary` extracted out of `services/tasks/source.ts` into a new `services/tasks/sourceSummary.ts` and consumed by both `crud.ts` and `source.ts`, breaking the crud↔source cycle (the historical `tasks.loadSourceSummary` re-export keeps route imports stable); (3) JWT helpers (`signJwt` / `verifyJwt` / `verifyJwtPayload` / `JWT_SECRET` / `JwtUser`) moved from `middleware/auth.ts` to a new `util/jwt.ts`, then re-exported from `middleware/auth.ts` so the historical import surface keeps working — `services/authService.ts` now imports from `util/jwt.js` directly to avoid the static `services → middleware/auth → services` back-edge; (4) `isAgentConnected` / `getCachedAgentState` / `getConnectedAgentIds` + the `agentStates` map + the `AgentState` type extracted into a new `services/agentLiveState.ts` registry. `agentWebSocket.ts` mutates the registry via `markAgentConnected` / `markAgentDisconnected` on its open / close callbacks; `agentService.ts` now imports the read helpers statically from the registry instead of via a runtime `await import("./agentWebSocket.js")` (which madge counted as a cycle). All four are pure file-organisation passes — no behaviour change, no public API removal; `tsc --noEmit` clean across server + web; `check-sdk-paths` + `check-db-access` still green.

### Removed
- **Two unused SDK contract paths deleted from the server route registry.** `SDK_PATHS.v1ChatTyping` (POST + GET `/api/v1/chat/typing`) and `SDK_PATHS.v1ChatAttachments` (POST `/api/v1/chat/attachments`) had no consumer on any of the three SDK lanes — the native Android chat (`BugpunchChatActivity`) routes its uploads through `/api/v1/chat/upload` (the `{ ref }`-shape replacement landed in #30 / #31) and never wired the typing-TTL endpoint. The route handlers + path entries are now removed (server `routes/paths.ts`, web `lib/paths.ts`, three handler bodies in `chat.routes.ts`); `npm run check-sdk-paths` is back to clean. Net: one less surface to reason about for SDK contract stability + the audit no longer false-positives. The orphaned `chatService.setSdkTyping` helper + the dashboard-side `sdkTyping` indicator (in `ChatPanel`, `ChatThreadList`) are now unreachable from the SDK; tracking re-wiring under a follow-up issue rather than ripping the consumer code out today.

### Fixed
- **Compile warnings cleared in C# DLL.** Three pre-existing CS0618 / CS0067 warnings from Unity 2023+ deprecations and a `#if UNITY_EDITOR`-only invoker were silenced via local `#pragma warning disable/restore` blocks rather than ripping out the surrounding code: `IStyle.unityBackgroundScaleMode` (×2 in `UIToolkitDialog`), `Physics.autoSyncTransforms` (×2 in `SettingsService` — settings panel still surfaces the flag for QA inspection), and `RoleState.OnChanged` (event invoker is gated by `#if UNITY_EDITOR`; the public event is kept on device for subscriber symmetry). No replacement APIs are wired yet (`IStyle` doesn't expose the new `background-*` shorthand at the time of writing); pragmas are scoped tight so a future replacement is a single-line swap. `dotnet build -c Release` is now warning-clean.

### Changed
- **First two slices of #34 — `ActionExecutor` shrinks via two more partial files.** New `ActionExecutor.SearchShortcuts.cs` (~71 lines) holds the top-level Search-query factory shortcuts (`Reflect` / `Name` / `Text` / `Type<T>` / `Type(string)` / `Texture` / `Path` / `Tag` / `Any` / `Adjacent` / `Near`) — pure one-liners that delegate to `new Search().X(...)`. New `ActionExecutor.SceneManagement.cs` (~306 lines) holds the `#region Scene Management` block (`LoadTestData`, `ClearPlayerPrefsSafe`, `RestorePlayerPrefsFromJson`, `WaitForStableFrameRate`, `SceneChange`, `NavigateToMainMenu`, `PlayerPrefsData` / `PlayerPrefsEntry` private types). Behaviour-neutral; bodies copied verbatim. Main file 2062 → 1723 lines (down 16% this pass; the file already had Gestures / Input / Pointers / Scrolling / UI partial-file extracts from prior sessions). Issue #34 stays open for further slices (Wait Methods @ ~600 lines and StaticPath resolver are the next big chunks).
- **Fifth (final) slice of #35 — collider streaming + overlay extracted to `SceneCameraService.Colliders.cs`** (~365 lines). Holds all collider state (cache list, known-id set, expansion radius, primitive line meshes, capsule cache, scan cache, colour constants, sensitivity epsilons, MaterialPropertyBlock), the late-update overlay path (`DrawCollidersOverlayIfActive`, `DrawColliderOverlay`, `TryBuildColliderDraw`), cache management (`RefreshColliderCache`, `EnsureUnitPrimitiveMeshes`, `GetOrBuildCapsuleLineMesh`, `ClearColliderPrimitiveCache`), and the public streaming API (`GetColliders`, `GetColliderTransforms`). Main file lands at **331 lines** — down 77% from the initial 1429. Issue #35 closed.
### Changed
- **Fourth slice of #35 — render-mode block extracted to `SceneCameraService.RenderModes.cs`** (~284 lines). Holds `_currentRenderMode` + render-mode state fields, `SetRenderMode` (public API), `CleanupRenderMode`, the cross-pipeline `HookRenderCallbacks` / `UnhookRenderCallbacks` and SRP / Built-in callback shims, `BeginRender` / `EndRender`, the `SwapInReplacementMaterials` / `RestoreMaterials` / `RefreshRendererCache` material-swap path, and `OverrideClearColor` / `RestoreClearColor`. Collider-specific fields stay in main for the next slice; SetRenderMode + CleanupRenderMode mutate them across the partial-class boundary. Main file 919 → 669 lines (down 53% from initial 1429 across all four slices).
### Changed
- **Third slice of #35 — `LateUpdate` split + wireframe overlay extracted to `SceneCameraService.Wireframe.cs`** (~122 lines). `LateUpdate` body separated into `DrawCollidersOverlayIfActive()` + `DrawWireframeOverlayIfActive()` so the two overlays don't share a single body. Wireframe block (its draw helper, `_edgeMeshes` cache, `GetOrBuildEdgeMesh`, `ClearEdgeMeshCache`, `WireframeMaxDrawsPerFrame` const) moved out. `_wireframeMaterial` / `_wireframeEnabled` stay in main because the render-mode set-up / tear-down code mutates them. `GetOrBuildEdgeMesh` is also reachable from the Colliders MeshCollider branch via the partial-class boundary — same accessibility, different file. Main file 999 → 919 lines.
### Changed
- **Second slice of #35 — camera-control surface extracted to `SceneCameraService.CameraControls.cs`** (~238 lines). `UpdateTransform`, `Orbit`, `Pan`, `Zoom`, `FocusOn`, `Look`, `Fly`, `ToggleProjection`, `SnapToAxis`, `SetGrid`, `ZoomDrag` moved verbatim. Pure file-organisation pass; no member's signature, visibility, or behaviour changed. Sensitivity constants stay in the main file (one is also used by `StartSceneCamera`'s init path). Main file now 999 lines (started at 1429 — down 30% across the two slices).
- **First slice of #35 — `SceneCameraService` now a `partial class` with pure static helpers extracted.** New `csharp-src/Bugpunch/Sources/RemoteIDE/Services/SceneCameraService.ColliderMesh.cs` (~263 lines) holds the mesh builders (`BuildUnitBoxLineMesh`, `BuildUnitSphereLineMesh`, `BuildCapsuleLineMesh`), the wireframe-overlay edge dedupe (`AddUniqueEdge`), the rigidbody-tier classifier (`ClassifyTier`), and the JSON shape serialisers (`SerializeAabb`, `SerializeShape`). Behaviour-neutral organisation pass — no member's signature or visibility changed; main file just delegates to the same statics across the partial-class boundary. Main file shrinks from 1429 → 1215 lines (~15%). Camera + collider-streaming + fly-controls split into separate partial files is the larger scope of #35; this slice unblocks the structural change.

### Fixed
- **#43 — SDK now actually POSTs the busy decline.** The C# `BugpunchClient.HandleUpgradeToWebSocket` SuppressInteractions branch was previously TODO'd; now it calls `BugpunchNative.ReportDebugBusy("busy")` which routes through the native lane (the device token only exists natively). Android: new `BugpunchPoller.reportDebugSessionBusy(reason)` static method POSTs `/api/device-poll/debug-busy` on the existing executor with the cached `X-Device-Token`. iOS: new `Bugpunch_ReportDebugBusy(const char* reason)` C export wraps the same POST through `BPPostJsonSync` on the poll queue. C# bridge: new `BugpunchNative.ReportDebugBusy(string reason)` with the standard Editor → Android (AndroidJavaClass.CallStatic) → iOS (P/Invoke `Bugpunch_ReportDebugBusy`) lane fan-out. Server endpoint + state machine landed earlier in this issue's first slice — `deviceService.reportDebugSessionBusy` stamps `lastDebugDecline` on the in-memory device state. Replay-protection (issuedAt TTL) + tests still pending as a follow-up.

- **#20 — iOS dSYM upload hook now uses the S3 multipart upload-direct flow.** The Run Script build phase injected by `iOSSymbolUploadHook` (Editor post-process @ priority 200) was POSTing dSYM slices to the legacy `/api/symbols/upload` endpoint, which the server removed in favour of `/api/symbols/upload-direct/{init,complete,abort}` (S3 multipart bypasses the Node process for the bytes). The shell script baked into the Xcode project now: (1) POSTs `init` with `{buildId, platform, abi, filename, contentLength}` to get an `uploadId` + presigned `parts[0].url`; (2) PUTs the lipo-thinned slice straight to the S3 URL and captures the response `ETag`; (3) POSTs `complete` with `{uploadId, key, parts: [{partNumber:1, etag}]}` to finalise the row. Aborts the multipart upload via `/abort` if the PUT fails so we don't leave billable orphan parts in S3 (bucket lifecycle reaps them after 7 days too, but explicit beats implicit). Single-part flow covers the typical post-`lipo -thin` slice (<100MB); multi-part for full-DWARF libil2cpp (1-2 GB) is a follow-up.

### Changed
- **#19 — `BugpunchConfig.symbolUploadEnabled` now defaults to `true`** in this dev workspace too. The public sdk repo's CHANGELOG already announced this in a prior release; the dev workspace's BugpunchConfig had been carrying the older `false` default. Server-side blockers from #19 (storage persistence + symbolicator RAM) are resolved on the Lightsail host (S3 multipart upload-direct + 4GB RAM); the SymbolUploader pipeline (`/api/symbols/check` then `/api/symbols/upload-direct/init` + `/complete`) is wired end-to-end. Tooltip updated to reflect the new default. Flag retained as a kill switch for local iterative builds where the per-build upload isn't worth it; can be removed entirely later if no consumer relies on toggling it.

### Fixed
- **#24 — `BugpunchConfig.buildChannel` now defaults to `Production`** instead of `Internal`. Internal-tagged builds force-elevate every install to the Internal tester role server-side (regardless of dashboard tagging) — turning ambient log streaming, native tunnel start, and Remote IDE eligibility on for any installer. The previous default meant a freshly-created config that shipped to production end-users would broadcast itself as Internal until the dev noticed. New default is safe by default; devs flip to `Internal` deliberately for QA / dogfood builds. The `BugpunchConfigBundle` pre-build hook also now warns loudly when `EditorUserBuildSettings.development` is false AND `buildChannel == Internal` ("Internal-tagged release builds force-elevate every install to the Internal tester role…"), so an accidental misconfiguration surfaces before the APK / IPA leaves the build machine. Suppress the warning by enabling Development Build, or switch the channel to Production / Beta. Tooltip on the field updated to document the safer default + the warning condition.
- **#25 — Remote IDE file root allow-list now enforces a directory boundary, not a string-prefix match.** `FileService.IsAllowed` (C#) and `BugpunchFileService.isAllowed` (Android) previously returned true on any normalised path that started with an allowed root's literal characters — so when `/app/data` was on the allow-list, sibling paths like `/app/data2`, `/app/database-backup`, or `/app/data-archive` all passed. The check now requires either exact equality with the root or a `/` separator immediately after the root, on both sides post-canonicalisation. Same fix applied symmetrically on both lanes (no iOS lane exists for the file service today). Gates apply to list / read / write / delete / mkdir / info / zip / unzip operations on both lanes.

### Changed
- **Fourth slice of #44 — Android JSON `http()` helpers route through `BugpunchHttp`.** New `BugpunchHttp.jsonRequest(method, url, headers, jsonBody, connectMs, readMs)` collapses the 30-line per-Activity `http()` helpers to ~10 lines that build the URL + headers and delegate. Both `BugpunchChatActivity.http` and `BugpunchFeedbackActivity.http` migrated. Removed the now-dead `addPlayerAuthHeaders(HttpURLConnection)`, `readError(HttpURLConnection)`, and `readAll(HttpURLConnection)` helpers from both Activities (player auth lives on `BugpunchHttp.baseHeaders` now; error-body drain is handled by `BugpunchHttp.readBody`). Side-effect: feedback's previously-silent non-2xx responses now log a warn line with the status code.
- **Third slice of #44 — C# `BugpunchHttp` mirrors the Android + iOS helpers.** New `csharp-src/Bugpunch/Sources/BugpunchHttp.cs` ships `Result { Code, Body, Ok }`, `BaseHeaders()` (composes `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` + `X-Device-Id` + `X-Player-*` from `BugpunchClient.Instance.Config` and `BugpunchRuntime`), and `MultipartUploadAsync(url, headers, fileBytes, fieldName, filename, mime, timeoutSeconds)` over `UnityWebRequest`. `BugpunchFeedbackBoard.Attachments.UploadDraftAttachment` migrated — drops the inline `UnityWebRequest.Post` + per-header writes + `Authorization`/`X-Device-Id`/`Accept` setup, kept the busy-state button toggle and the `JObject` parse for the `{url, mime, width, height}` response shape. Failed uploads now log `code=… body=…` (was: just the response code) so server error envelopes surface in the SDK warn line. C# was the last lane on the list — feedback board is the only call site after the C# chat board was removed in #40.
- **Second slice of #44 — iOS `BPHttpClient` mirrors `BugpunchHttp.java`.** New `ios-src/Bugpunch/Sources/BugpunchHttpClient.{h,mm}` ships `+[BPHttpClient baseHeaders]` (composes X-Api-Key + X-Device-Id + X-Player-* from `BPRuntime`) and `+[BPHttpClient multipartUploadURL:headers:filePath:fieldName:filename:mime:timeout:session:]` returning a `BPHttpResult { code, body, ok }`. The synchronous body uses the caller's `NSURLSession` so chat / feedback continue to share their VC's session config (timeouts, cookie storage, delegate). Both `-[BugpunchChatViewController uploadAttachmentSync:]` and `-[BugpunchFeedbackViewController uploadAttachmentSync:]` migrated — each call site shrinks from ~50 lines to ~25 and now logs the server's error body on non-2xx (was: silent return). The 5MB feedback pre-flight stays on the call site (UX choice, not transport). C# slice still pending; the only remaining C# board after #40 is `BugpunchFeedbackBoard`.
- **First slice of #44 — `BugpunchHttp` consolidates Android multipart upload paths.** New `android-src/bugpunch/src/main/java/au/com/oddgames/bugpunch/BugpunchHttp.java` owns the boundary + headers + byte-streaming pattern that was hand-rolled in `BugpunchChatActivity.uploadAttachment` and `BugpunchFeedbackActivity.uploadAttachment` (and that would have grown a third copy when the next chat-capture path landed). Both Activities now compose `BugpunchHttp.baseHeaders(this)` (which folds in `X-Api-Key`, `X-Device-Id`, and the `X-Player-*` headers when player identity is configured) and call `BugpunchHttp.multipartUpload(url, headers, file, "file", filename, mime, connectMs, readMs)`. The shared helper also reads non-2xx error bodies (via `pickStream` → `errorStream`) so failed uploads now surface the server's JSON envelope in the warn log instead of a bare `code=400`. Each Activity keeps its own response-shape parsing (`{ref}` for chat, `{url, mime, width, height}` for feedback) since those diverge by design. Player-auth / JSON-request consolidation still pending (next slice). iOS / C# lanes untouched in this slice — same shape will move to `BPHttpClient.mm` and `BugpunchHttp.cs` when the iOS / C# call sites get migrated.

### Removed
- **C# UIToolkit chat board** (`UI/BugpunchChatBoard.cs`, `BugpunchChatBoard.Composer.cs`, `BugpunchChatBoard.MessageView.cs`, `BugpunchChatBoard.Styling.cs` plus `.meta` files — ~1.8k LOC). Per #40, chat is now native iOS / Android only: Android renders `BugpunchChatActivity`, iOS renders `BugpunchChatViewController`, and Editor / Standalone / WebGL log a diagnostic and skip chat entirely (no managed fallback). `ShowChatBoardForActiveLane` in `BugpunchClient.cs`, `OnAskForHelp` in `BugpunchRequestHelpPicker.cs`, `FallbackDialog.ShowChatBoard`, and `UIToolkitDialog.ShowChatBoard` all updated to log + skip when the active lane is managed. `INativeDialog.ShowChatBoard` xmldoc updated. `BugpunchUIToolkit` header comment dropped its `BugpunchChatBoard` reference. Preflight `android-native-ui` check updated: now bans any `UI.BugpunchChatBoard.Show()` call site directly while still requiring `ShowFeedbackBoardForActiveLane` to route native lanes back to native dialogs (feedback board still has the managed fallback). The `BugpunchFeedbackBoard.*.cs` family stays — a separate ticket will cover the same split when the consent / feedback flow needs revisiting.

### Added
- **AdMob `WithBugpunch()` instrumentation** (`Ads/BugpunchAdMob.cs`). Mirrors the `BugpunchPurchasing.WithBugpunch(this IStoreListener inner)` pattern — one extension call per AdMob ad instance subscribes Bugpunch telemetry to that ad's lifecycle events (`OnAdFullScreenContentOpened`/`Closed`/`Failed`, `OnAdClicked`, `OnAdPaid`, plus `OnBannerAdLoaded`/`OnBannerAdLoadFailed` for banners) and forwards them to `Bugpunch.LogAd` as the standard `shown / click / fail / paid / close` action vocabulary. Covers `RewardedAd`, `InterstitialAd`, `AppOpenAd`, `RewardedInterstitialAd`, and `BannerView`. Idempotent via a `ConditionalWeakTable` so wrapping the same ad twice is a no-op; weak keys mean garbage-collected ads drop out automatically. Gated behind a new `ODDGames.Bugpunch.Ads` asmdef with a `com.google.ads.mobile` 9.0+ versionDefine — file isn't in the build when the AdMob package is absent, no reflection, no runtime overhead. Rewarded reward delivery still goes through the user-supplied `Show(Action<Reward>)` callback (not an event), so game code must call `Bugpunch.LogAd("reward", "rewarded", "admob", placement)` from inside that callback if reward attribution is needed — documented inline.

## [1.8.9] - 2026-05-08

### Changed
- **`BugpunchPurchasing` ported to Unity IAP v5.** `IStoreListener` / `IDetailedStoreListener` were removed by Unity in `com.unity.purchasing` 5.0; the wrapper now subscribes to `IPurchaseService.OnPurchaseConfirmed` and side-channels each confirmed purchase to `Bugpunch.LogPurchase`. Integration is now `UnityIAPServices.DefaultPurchase().WithBugpunch()`. The asmdef references `Unity.Purchasing` (was `UnityEngine.Purchasing`) and the `BUGPUNCH_HAS_UNITY_IAP` version-define gate moved to `5.0.0`. v4 IAP support is dropped — projects on `com.unity.purchasing` < 5.0 should pin SDK ≤ 1.8.8 or upgrade IAP.

### Added
- **Diagnostics service** + **on-demand chat video capture** (rides the existing pre-crash ring buffer; #39).
- **Native chat composer typing posts** wired through to the server (#49 native side).

### Fixed
- Replay buffered logs on tunnel `onConnected` for cached internal role.
- Read verified role state in `ensureReportTunnelIfInternal` (#26).
- Tunnel idle-sweep cycle no longer skips connections.
- API keys list display + show device's project ID.
- SDK bootstrap unified on `register` response — single source of truth for runtime config.

## [1.8.8] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Unity Editor F12 video ring now targets 60 FPS and ships a Windows native recorder build.** The Editor recorder backend now honours `RecorderSettings` width/height/fps instead of forcing 1280x720 @ 15 FPS, and the F12 ring requests 1280x720 @ 60 FPS. The package now includes `Plugins/Windows/ODDRecorder.dll` plus a `build-odd-recorder.ps1` helper; the VS Code `Build SDK DLLs` task rebuilds the native DLL after the managed DLLs.
- **Windows native recorder can write D3D11 GPU texture samples to Media Foundation.** `ODDRecorder` now vendors Unity's official PluginAPI headers, acquires `IUnityGraphicsD3D11::GetDevice()` during `UnityPluginLoad`, attaches an `IMFDXGIDeviceManager` when native capture starts, writes `ID3D11Texture2D` frames via `MFCreateDXGISurfaceBuffer`, and falls back to the old staging/`Map()` CPU path only when GPU sample submission is unavailable for that frame. On Windows Editor, the recorder backend now selects this native D3D11 path when `ODDRecorder.dll` is present, with Unity Recorder kept as the fallback.

## [1.8.7] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Player builds no longer fail with `Failed to resolve assembly: 'nunit.framework'` during IL2CPP linking.** `UIAutomationTestFixture` was compiled into the runtime DLL via `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`, which baked NUnit type references into the IL — fine for tests, fatal for player builds where `nunit.framework.dll` isn't shipped. The fixture has moved to `Tests/UIAutomationTestFixture.cs` under a new `ODDGames.Bugpunch.Tests` asmdef gated on `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` with `nunit.framework.dll` as a precompiled reference, so it only compiles in the consumer's test-runner context. The runtime's `TestReport` now exposes an `internal SetOutcome(bool)` hook the fixture pushes NUnit's outcome through, keeping pass/fail semantics identical without the runtime DLL referencing NUnit.

## [1.8.6] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **SDK three-lane architecture is now structural, not aspirational.** Cross-lane class names align across Java + iOS + C# (`BugpunchClient`, `BugpunchRuntime`, `BugpunchDebugMode`, `BugpunchPoller`, `BugpunchCrashHandler`, …) so a feature owner can grep one identifier and find every implementation. C# `UnityExceptionForwarder` renamed to `BugpunchCrashHandler` to mirror its Java + iOS siblings (which handle native signals; the C# one handles managed exceptions). New `BugpunchPlatform.cs` is the lane router and logs the active lane on startup. iOS got a new `BugpunchRuntime.{h,mm}` that holds the cross-lane runtime state (config / metadata / customData / fps / started / lastAutoReport / reportInProgress) — `BPDebugMode` shrinks to just the consent + recording flow, mirroring Java's split. Cross-lane code on iOS now reads `[BPRuntime shared]` instead of `[BPDebugMode shared]`.
- **`DeviceConnect/` folder retired.** C# files that mirror native siblings (`BugpunchClient.cs`, `BugpunchDebugMode.cs`, `BugpunchPoller.cs`, `BugpunchRuntime.cs`, `BugpunchCrashHandler.cs`, `BugpunchNative.cs`, `BugpunchPlatform.cs`, `CrashDirectiveHandler.cs`, `BugpunchInputCapture.cs`, `BugpunchSurfaceRecorder.cs`, …) live at `package/` root — same flat layout as the Java side. The Remote IDE feature module moved to `package/RemoteIDE/`; `Config/` and `UI/` hoisted to package root. Namespaces collapse: `ODDGames.Bugpunch.DeviceConnect` → `ODDGames.Bugpunch`; `ODDGames.Bugpunch.RemoteIDE` for IDE; `ODDGames.Bugpunch.UI` for UI.
- **`BugpunchRuntime` is the only source of cross-lane shared state in C#.** `BugpunchClient.cs` is no longer where mirrors read config / suppression / host references from — they go through `BugpunchRuntime` exactly like Java's `BugpunchPoller.java` reads `BugpunchRuntime.getServerUrl()`. `BugpunchClient.PushSuppression()` still works; its counter just lives on `BugpunchRuntime` now.

### Added
- **`RemoteIDE/BugpunchUnity.cs` facade.** Single public entry point for the Remote IDE module — `BugpunchUnity.BuildServices(host)` constructs every IDE service and returns the wired `RequestRouter` + `SceneCameraService`. `BugpunchClient.BuildLazyServices` collapsed from 45 lines to one delegate call. Future work can drive remaining IDE service types to `internal` access so the module's public surface is just `BugpunchUnity` + the few types `BugpunchClient` still surfaces.
- **Preflight three-lane gates** (`/deploy-sdk` won't ship past these). New `three-lane` check verifies declared cross-lane mirrors exist on every lane they ship on (manifest pins Runtime / DebugMode / Poller / CrashHandler across all three lanes; Uploader / Tunnel / Screenshot for Java + iOS). New `cross-lane-client` check flags any `BugpunchClient.X` reference inside a C# mirror file — comments and `using` directives are skipped, the rule mirrors how Java/iOS siblings depend on `BugpunchRuntime` not on a "client" type.

### Added
- **"Send to Bugpunch" button on the SDK error overlay** — the expanded SDK-error card (`BugpunchSdkErrorOverlay`) now has a Send button alongside Clear/Dismiss. Tapping it bundles the captured ring buffer (source, message, count, stack for each entry) and enqueues it as an `"exception"` report through the standard upload pipeline. The most-recent entry's stack anchors the server-side fingerprint so recurring SDK errors group into one issue; all entries land in customData with flat `sdkError.entry.N.*` keys + a `bugpunchSdkError: true` flag for dashboard filtering. Disabled when the ring is empty; bypasses the exception-type cooldown since it's user-initiated. Wired on Android (`BugpunchSdkErrorOverlay.enqueueRingAsExceptionReport` → `BugpunchReportingService.reportBug`) and iOS (`-[BPSdkErrorOverlay onSendTap:]` → `Bugpunch_ReportBug`); new `Bugpunch_ResetAutoReportCooldown` C export added to `BugpunchDebugMode.mm` for the cooldown bypass.

### Added
- **Persistent chat-message banner** — when a dev replies in chat the SDK now surfaces a small top pill ("💬 N new messages from a dev") instead of force-opening the full chat board. Tap the pill to open the chat (which marks read); tap the X to snooze until a newer dev message arrives. Shares the visual style of the crash-upload banner, sits just below it so both can be visible at once.
  - Android: new `BugpunchChatBanner` (mirrors `BugpunchUploadStatusBanner`), driven via `BugpunchRuntime.showChatBanner(int)` / `hideChatBanner()`.
  - iOS: new `BugpunchTopBanner.mm` with two singletons (`BPUploadBanner`, `BPChatBanner`). Wires the iOS uploader to render an upload progress pill that previously only existed on Android — feature parity with `BugpunchUploadStatusBanner.java`. Driven via `Bugpunch_TopBanner_ShowChat` / `_HideChat`.
  - C#: `BugpunchClient.ChatReplyHeartbeat` now counts unread QA messages and calls `BugpunchNative.ShowChatBanner(unread)` instead of `UI.BugpunchChatBoard.Show()`. New `OnChatBannerDismissed` / `OnChatBannerOpened` UnitySendMessage receivers handle the snooze-until-newer behaviour.

### Fixed
- **Multi-minute video uploads on exception/crash reports.** The Android recorder's pause-time compensation (`mAccumPausedUs`) was accumulating across every pause/resume cycle (bug form, chat, annotate, tools panel each pause once), and the trim/dump cutoff subtracted it — so after several UI interactions the dump cutoff could drift back several minutes and the resulting video covered the entire session up to that point. The compensation now SETS (not adds) on each post-resume sample and is clamped at `windowSeconds`, so the dump duration is bounded at 2× the configured window even after a single long pause.

### Changed
- **Default `videoBufferSeconds` raised from 30 → 90.** Tier-based fallback (used when the inspector default isn't overridden) becomes 30/60/90s for low/mid/high. Affects in-RAM ring dumps for exception/bug reports; the crash-survivable native ring is still clamped to [30, 90]s.

### Added
- **Per-report log boundary marker.** After a report's logs are snapshotted for upload, the SDK injects a synthetic `Bugpunch.Boundary` line into the live log ring. The next report's log buffer carries that line, and the dashboard's log viewer collapses everything above the most recent boundary into a click-to-expand divider — so testers can see "since last report" at a glance without losing access to earlier context. Wired on Android (`BugpunchLogReader.markBoundary`) and iOS (`BPLogReader markBoundaryWithType:title:`); fires from both auto-reports (`reportBug`) and user-submitted reports (`submitReport` / `Bugpunch_SubmitReport`).

### Added
- **Crash video diagnostic.** When a crash event has no usable video the SDK now uploads a short `bugpunchDiag_video` text attachment with a stable reason token (`ring_missing`, `no_csd_yet`, `no_samples`, `ring_overwritten`, `no_keyframe`, `ring_bad_header`, `ring_truncated`, `remux_threw`) so the dashboard can show *why* video is unavailable instead of silently omitting it. Lands as a game attachment on the issue event — no server schema change. (Android only this round; iOS to follow.)

### Changed
- **Encoder primes with a synthetic black frame on every recorder start (buffer mode + projection mode).** Previously a crash within ~1 second of `EnterDebugMode` produced a video ring with no SPS/PPS (encoder hadn't emitted its first format yet) and the remuxer rejected it as `no_csd_yet`. Both startup paths now push one black frame the moment the encoder is started: buffer mode queues a cached NV12 array via `queueFrame`; projection mode draws onto the input Surface via `lockHardwareCanvas` *before* `createVirtualDisplay` attaches the screen mirror. Either way CSD + first IDR land in ~100-200 ms, so a startup-time crash still has playable video. Black frame slides out of the rolling window as soon as real content arrives.

### Fixed
- **`attachmentsAvailable` builder centralised** in `BugpunchUploader.collectAvailableRequires(attachments, deferred)` (Java) and `BPCollectAvailableRequires` + `BPInjectAttachmentsAvailable` (Obj-C++). Both platforms now patch the phase-1 JSON body with the union of every non-empty `requires` key on the attachments list before write. iOS was previously relying on the server's "absent → admit everything" legacy fallback; that worked at the time but would have broken silently the moment iOS gained any preflight attachment with a `requires` key. Contract is documented in `sdk/docs/upload-manifest.md`.
- **Crash events were uploading without logs / screenshots / breadcrumbs.** The new preflight/enrich flow filters phase-2 multipart fields by the server's `collect[]` response, and the server only includes a field in `collect[]` if the SDK advertised it in `attachmentsAvailable`. The SDK was building that list from `DeferredAttachment.requires` only — regular `FileAttachment.requires` keys (`logs`, `screenshot`, etc.) were never advertised, so every crash event uploaded with just the JSON body and was missing every heavy attachment. Exceptions weren't affected because they go through `BugpunchReportingService` which used the older one-stage path. Now `enqueuePreflight` walks both `attachments` and `deferred` when building `available`, so logs/screenshots come through for crashes too.
- **`startBufferMode` / `start` (projection) now block until the encoder publishes CSD into the ring.** A `CountDownLatch` released from `publishVideoFormat` gates EnterDebugMode return, with a 750 ms safety timeout. Combined with the black-frame primer from this same release, this closes the timing race where a fast crash (e.g. `Marshal.WriteInt32(IntPtr.Zero, 0)` on the first Update after EnterDebugMode) hit the signal handler before any encoded sample existed and produced a `no_csd_yet` ring. Slower crashes (stack overflow's recursion, abort) already worked because they spent enough cycles for CSD to land naturally.
- **Duplicate native crash events.** AEI synthesis was emitting `type:CRASH_NATIVE` while bp.c writes `type:NATIVE_SIGNAL`, so the merge step in `findMatchingCrashFile` never matched and every native crash uploaded twice (once from bp.c, once from AEI). Aligned `mapReasonToType` to bp.c's names so AEI augments the existing .crash with `---AEI---` metadata instead of synthesising a duplicate. Also fixes the dashboard's "Unknown: CRASH_NATIVE" labels — those rows were the duplicates the dashboard didn't recognise.

### Removed
- **Standalone SDK dashboard (`sdk/web/`) deleted.** The package no longer ships a separate React dashboard — `server/web` (bugpunch.com) is the only browser surface. `sdk/web/` had drifted from the server dashboard (its own `authFetch`, login flow, Vite + Tailwind config) without ever reaching parity. Anything that used to live there moves into `server/web` or the Remote IDE; the SDK itself stays focused on the package + native uploaders + CLI.

### Added
- **`sdk/docs/` cross-platform contracts.** New canonical specs that pin shared behavior across the Android Java and iOS Obj-C++ implementations:
  - `sdk/docs/upload-manifest.md` — the on-disk multipart manifest schema (single-stage + two-stage preflight + enrich), pinned constants (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`, timeouts, queue dir), and the field-by-field reference. Both `BugpunchUploader.java` and `BugpunchUploader.mm` link to this doc instead of duplicating the schema in their own headers.
  - `sdk/docs/shake-spec.md` — accelerometer-shake algorithm, pinned constants (500 ms spike window, 2 s cooldown, 2 spikes to fire), and the m/s² magnitude formula on each platform. Both shake detectors now emit a `shake_fired` analytics event with `{platform}` so dashboards surface drift if one side stops firing.

### Changed
- **`BugpunchJson` is now the only JSON-string escape path in the SDK.** Removed 14 redeclared `Esc` / `EscapeJson` / `EscJson` private helpers in service / editor / config files (they all delegate to `BugpunchJson.Esc` now). Dropped one minor behavior divergence: callsites that used to strip `\r` from output now emit a proper `\r` escape — JSON parsers see a literal CR instead of "the CR was here" silently disappearing. Also removed the public `RequestRouter.EscapeJson` API since `BugpunchJson.Esc` covers the same job; `BugpunchClient.cs` callers updated.
- **`BugpunchRetry.ExponentialBackoff(attempt, initialMs, capMs)`.** New helper at `sdk/package/DeviceConnect/BugpunchRetry.cs` replaces two divergent inline backoff formulas (`Math.Pow`-based in `IdeTunnel`, bitshift-based in `SymbolUploadClient`). One implementation, overflow-guarded, used by both call sites. Java/Obj-C++ uploaders pin to the same shape via `sdk/docs/upload-manifest.md`.
- **`Bugpunch.cs` dictionary serializer uses `BugpunchJson.Esc`.** `SerializeTags` / `SerializeDict` / `AppendJsonValue` previously had their own `EscJson` whose control-char output disagreed with the rest of the SDK; that's gone.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Unified ingest endpoint (breaking).** All issue submissions — crashes, exceptions, ANRs, bug reports, feedback items — now POST to a single `/api/issues/ingest` endpoint with a `type` field discriminator (`crash` | `exception` | `anr` | `bug_report` | `feedback_item`). The legacy `/api/crashes`, `/api/reports/bug`, and `/api/feedback` (POST) ingest paths are gone server-side. Two-phase crash uploads now hit `/api/issues/events/{id}/enrich`. Native uploaders (Android Java, iOS Obj-C++) and C# (Bugpunch.cs, FleetSimulator.cs, BugpunchFeedbackBoard.Http.cs) all updated. Legacy `category` field on crash payloads renamed to `type` (Android keeps `category` alongside for one release for backwards compat). Server runs the unified backend; this SDK release is the corresponding client.
- **Crash & bug-report status workflow is now per-project.** The hardcoded `new|open|resolved|ready_to_verify|ignored|regressed` enum is replaced with an admin-editable status pool on the dashboard (Settings → Issue workflow). The SDK doesn't see this directly — status moves are server/dashboard-only — but if you've automated dashboards against the legacy enum, switch to filtering by status `category` (`backlog|unstarted|started|completed|canceled`) instead.

## [1.7.46] - 2026-04-26

### Changed
- **Unread-chat badge on the floating button (#32).** When the dev team has chat replies the player hasn't seen, the in-game floating button shows a small accent-coloured `(N)` badge (`99+` when count >= 100). Android renders it on the recording overlay's red record button (top-right corner of a new `FrameLayout` wrapper, `BugpunchReportOverlay.setUnreadCount(int)`); iOS renders it on the floating debug widget (`BugpunchDebugWidget.mm`, exposed via `Bugpunch_SetUnreadCount(int)`). The count is fetched by the existing `BugpunchPoller` on every other tick (≈ 60s at the default 30s cadence — no second timer) via a new `GET /api/v1/chat/unread` endpoint that returns `{ count, lastFromQaAt }` for the device's thread, counting messages with `Sender == 'qa'` and `read_by_sdk_at IS NULL`. Opening the chat clears the badge instantly (`markRead` on both `BugpunchChatActivity.java` and `BugpunchChatViewController.mm` calls `setUnreadCount(0)` straight after `POST /api/v1/chat/read` so the player isn't waiting for the next poll). Server endpoint reuses the existing `requireAuth` + `X-Device-Id` SDK auth pattern; service layer adds `chatService.getUnreadForDevice(projectId, deviceId)`.
- **Native Android chat board (Phase A of #29).** The "Ask for help" surface is now a real native `BugpunchChatActivity` (`sdk/android-src/.../BugpunchChatActivity.java`) — Messenger-style header + bubble list + composer, HTTP and 5s polling all in Java. The previous flow bounced through `UnitySendMessage` and rendered in C# UI Toolkit on top of the Unity surface; the native version draws above it like every other Bugpunch overlay and matches the picker's look. Bubbles size asymmetrically (4dp tail), URLs autolink, timestamps live underneath. Composer has a `+` attach button that opens an inline pill with **Screenshot** / **Record video** options — screenshot is wired (uses `BugpunchScreenshot.captureThen`, returns to chat with a thumbnail chip in the composer); video shows a "coming soon" toast pending the projection-callback refactor (#30). Pending attachments render as removable chips above the input row and are uploaded multipart to `POST /api/v1/chat/upload` on send. Inline **Approve / Decline** buttons render on incoming `scriptRequest` / `dataRequest` bubbles per #31 — answering hits `POST /api/v1/chat/request/answer` and stamps the bubble with a final-state badge; full ScriptRunner JNI bridge is the follow-up. `AndroidDialog.ShowChatBoard` no longer round-trips to C# on Android; iOS / Editor / Standalone fallback path is unchanged.
- **Native iOS chat board (Phase B of #29).** Same surface ported to Obj-C++ as `BugpunchChatViewController` (`sdk/package/Plugins/iOS/BugpunchChatViewController.mm`), a full-screen `UIViewController` that mirrors the Android Activity — Messenger header (avatar circle + title + subtitle + close ✕), `UIScrollView` of bubble cells with asymmetric corner masks (`UIBezierPath` `byRoundingCorners:` per side), composer with `+` attach toggle, attach pill with **📷 Screenshot** / **🎥 Record video**, pending-attachment chips, inline **Approve / Decline** for `scriptRequest` / `dataRequest`, URL autolink via `NSDataDetector`, 5s polling on `NSTimer`, multipart upload via `NSURLSession`. `Bugpunch_ShowChatBoard` in `BugpunchReportOverlay.mm` no longer fires `UnitySendMessage("OnShowChatBoardRequested")` — it presents the new VC directly via `UIModalPresentationFullScreen`. Reuses the shared `[BPDebugMode shared].config` `serverUrl` / `apiKey` accessors (same pattern as `BugpunchPoller.mm` / `BugpunchDirectives.mm`), `Bugpunch_GetStableDeviceId` for the `X-Device-Id` header, and `Bugpunch_CaptureScreenshot` for the screenshot capture. Video stub mirrors Android — shows a "coming soon" alert pending the consent/recording refactor (#30). The C# `BugpunchChatBoard.cs` stays as the Editor / Standalone fallback.
- **Approved `scriptRequest` / `dataRequest` chat bubbles now actually run (#31).** Both native chat surfaces previously stamped the bubble approved and posted a hard-coded `"✓ Approved on device. Script runner bridge pending — full output will arrive once #31 is wired."` placeholder. The native `runScriptSafe` stub is gone (Android `BugpunchChatActivity.answerRequest` / iOS `BugpunchChatViewController -answerRequest:approved:`) — instead, on Approve native base64-encodes the body, builds `<messageId>|<base64>`, and `UnitySendMessage`s `BugpunchClient.OnApprovedScriptRequest` / `OnApprovedDataRequest`. The new C# receivers in `BugpunchClient.cs` decode the source, run it through the existing `ScriptRunner.Execute(...)` (returns the `{"ok":true,"output":"..."}` JSON envelope), and POST the result to `/api/v1/chat/message` with `inReplyTo: messageId` — picked up by the next native poll and rendered as a normal team-side bubble. `dataRequest` is wired the same way but stubbed for v1 (`"Got your data request: …\n\nTunnel-based collectors are next."`) — full collector pipeline is the next slice. No JNI bridge, no extra surface on `ScriptRunner` — UnitySendMessage is the only seam.
- **Chat video attachments (#30).** The `🎥 Record video` option in the chat composer's attach pill is now real on both platforms — previously a "coming soon" toast / alert. Tapping it dismisses the chat to the live game view, asks for screen-record consent, floats a red "Stop ⏺" pill anchored top-center on the host, and on Stop hands the resulting `.mp4` back to the chat as a pending attachment chip. On send it multipart-uploads to the existing `POST /api/v1/chat/upload` and rides through with the message. **Android:** generalised `BugpunchProjectionRequest` (`sdk/android-src/.../BugpunchProjectionRequest.java`) — added a `JavaProjectionCallback` interface + `requestForJavaCallback(Activity, JavaProjectionCallback)` overload so the consent result can flow to a native callback instead of always bouncing through `UnitySendMessage`; the legacy Unity-callback `request(...)` overload (used by the bug-report ring-buffer flow) is untouched and still does the buffer-mode fallback on denial. Added a single-segment write path to `BugpunchRecorder` (`startSegmentToPath(activity, resultCode, resultData, dpi, outputPath)` + `isLastSegmentValid()`) which lazily opens a `MediaMuxer` once the encoder reports its output format, pipes every keyframe-aligned sample to disk alongside the ring buffer, and finalises on `stop()`. `BugpunchProjectionService` learns a new `EXTRA_SEGMENT_OUTPUT_PATH` extra and routes to `startSegmentToPath` when present so the chat path reuses the existing FG-service plumbing (Android 14+ requirement) without forking. `BugpunchChatActivity.startVideoAttachment` does the actual orchestration — `moveTaskToBack(true)` to hide the chat, request consent, start the FG service in segment mode, show a `WindowManager`-overlaid Stop pill (`accentRecord` fill + white dot + "Stop ⏺", anchored top-center 48dp from top), and on Stop call `BugpunchRecorder.getInstance().stop()`, validate the file, re-launch the chat with `FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT`, and append the MP4 path as a pending attachment. **iOS:** chat VC video stub replaced — uses the existing `ODDRecorder` (`ODDRecorder.h` / `.mm`) which wraps `RPScreenRecorder.startCapture` (system consent prompt is built-in) and writes a single MP4 via `AVAssetWriter`. `BugpunchChatViewController -onStartVideo` dismisses the chat, starts the recorder targeting `NSTemporaryDirectory()/bp_chat_video_<ms>.mp4`, and floats a Stop pill on the key window with the same `accentRecord` styling as Android. On Stop tap, it calls `ODDRecorder_Stop`, validates the file, re-presents the chat VC, and adds the MP4 as a pending chip via the new `-appendPendingVideoAttachment:` hook. Bug-report video flow (`BugpunchRingRecorder` ring buffer) is untouched on iOS. **Server:** `chatService.ts` adds `video/mp4` to the `ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_MIMES` map, introduces `MAX_VIDEO_ATTACHMENT_BYTES = 30 * 1024 * 1024`, and exposes `maxBytesForAttachmentMime(mime)` so the route layer can apply a per-MIME cap (multer ceiling stays at 30 MB; images are still gated at 5 MB). `AttachmentDescriptor.type` widens from `"image"` to `"image" | "video"`; `parseAttachmentsJson` accepts both kinds, and `parseInboundAttachments` in `chat.routes.ts` now allows `type: "video"` and cross-checks the type/mime pair to catch mismatches. The three chat-upload routes (`/api/v1/chat/upload` + the two dashboard variants) all enforce the per-MIME cap with a 413 response on overflow. `attachmentService.uploadAttachment` mirrors the per-MIME cap for any direct caller. The existing static `/api/files/*` middleware serves `.mp4` with the right `video/mp4` content-type out of the box. The C# Editor / Standalone fallback chat board (`BugpunchChatBoard.cs`) is untouched — video remains device-only for v1.
- **Native iOS feedback board (Phase B part 2 of #29).** Same surface ported to Obj-C++ as `BugpunchFeedbackViewController` (`sdk/package/Plugins/iOS/BugpunchFeedbackViewController.mm`), a full-screen `UIViewController` that mirrors the Android Activity — three views (List / Detail / Submit) swapped by replacing the body container's children, same vote-pill model (vertical pill on rows, horizontal "N votes" pill in the detail; 48pt+ tap target; accent fill when voted; pill's own `UITapGestureRecognizer` swallows the row tap so an upvote doesn't open detail), inline similarity prompt with **Vote for that** / **Post mine anyway** when `/api/feedback/similarity` returns a match scoring > 0.85. Detail view renders the body with `NSDataDetector`-underlined URLs (no markdown for v1, matching Android), image-thumb attachments (local-path bitmap or 📷 placeholder + tap-to-open for server URLs), comments list with author + staff badge, dense comment composer (📷 attach + `UITextView` + accent ➤ send circle). Submit view has title + description + screenshot attach; on send it hits `/api/feedback/similarity` first, then either creates directly or routes through the inline similarity prompt. HTTP, multipart upload, optimistic vote-flip and reconciliation all in `NSURLSession` — endpoints: `GET /api/feedback?sort=votes`, `POST /api/feedback`, `POST /api/feedback/similarity`, `POST /api/feedback/<id>/vote`, `GET|POST /api/feedback/<id>/comments`, multipart `POST /api/feedback/attachments`. `Bugpunch_ShowFeedbackBoard` in `BugpunchReportOverlay.mm` no longer falls through to the C# board — it presents the new VC directly via `UIModalPresentationFullScreen`. `IOSDialog.ShowFeedbackBoard` now calls the native extern instead of `BugpunchFeedbackBoard.Show()`. Reuses the shared `[BPDebugMode shared].config` `serverUrl` / `apiKey` accessors (same pattern as `BugpunchPoller.mm` / `BugpunchChatViewController.mm`), `Bugpunch_GetStableDeviceId` for the `X-Device-Id` header, `Bugpunch_CaptureScreenshot` for screenshot attach (with the same dismiss → snap → re-present dance the chat VC uses), and `BPTheme` / `BPStrings` for colours / fonts / strings. The C# `BugpunchFeedbackBoard.cs` stays as the Editor / Standalone fallback.
- **Native Android feedback board (Phase A part 2 of #29).** The "Request a feature" surface is now a real native `BugpunchFeedbackActivity` (`sdk/android-src/.../BugpunchFeedbackActivity.java`) with three views in one Activity: list (search field + vote pills + `+ New feedback` CTA), detail (back chevron, full body with `Linkify.WEB_URLS` autolinking — markdown rendering deferred per #29 v1 simplification — image-thumb attachments, comments list, dense single-line composer with screenshot attach), and submit (title / description / screenshot attach with similarity check on send). HTTP, similarity scoring, vote toggle, comments and multipart upload all live in Java — endpoints: `GET /api/feedback?sort=votes`, `POST /api/feedback`, `POST /api/feedback/similarity`, `POST /api/feedback/<id>/vote`, `GET|POST /api/feedback/<id>/comments`, multipart `POST /api/feedback/attachments`. Vote pill is a 48dp+ tap target that fills with `accentFeedback` when voted and stops row-click propagation so an upvote doesn't open the detail. Submit hits the similarity endpoint first; a match scoring > 0.85 routes through an inline prompt with **Vote for that** / **Post mine anyway** before creating a duplicate. Screenshot capture uses the existing `BugpunchScreenshot.captureThen`; video attachments are out of scope per #30. New `INativeDialog.ShowFeedbackBoard()` — Android launches the Activity via `BugpunchReportOverlay.showFeedbackBoard()`; iOS / Editor / Standalone keep falling back to the C# `BugpunchFeedbackBoard.Show()`. `BugpunchRequestHelpPicker.OnRequestFeature` and the recording-bar feedback shortcut now route through the dialog factory so the picker → native Activity wire-up is consistent across surfaces.

## [1.7.45] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **`[Watch]` attribute drives the Watch panel.** New `WatchAttribute` (`sdk/package/WatchAttribute.cs`, global namespace) lets devs annotate any field/property on a `MonoBehaviour` with `[Watch]`, optional `group`, `min`/`max`, and a `WatchOwner` enum (`Self` / `Parent` / `Root`). `WatchService` scans loaded scenes on startup and after every `sceneLoaded`/`sceneUnloaded` event (rebuild is lazy on the next `/watch/poll` so there's no frame hitch on scene change), registering each annotated member as a "declared" watch entry. The Remote IDE Watch panel renders declared entries in collapsible sections grouped by `group ?? ownerName`, with sliders for ranged numerics and toggles for booleans, while user-pinned watches keep working below. New endpoint `POST /watch/rescan` for manual refresh; declared-watch metadata rides along the existing `/watch/poll` and `/watch/apply` pipelines so the polling cadence and write path are unchanged. `WatchAttribute` + `WatchOwner` are added to `link.xml` so IL2CPP doesn't strip them off user fields. `WatchService.ClearAll` now flags declared watches dirty so they reappear automatically on the next poll — clearing only wipes user-pinned entries from the user's POV.
- **Shader / Material Profiler in the Remote IDE.** New `ShaderProfilerService` (`sdk/package/DeviceConnect/Services/ShaderProfilerService.cs`) registered on `RequestRouter` under `/shader-profile/*`. It enumerates every `Renderer` in the loaded scenes (incl. inactive + DontDestroyOnLoad), groups them by shader name (or material instance), then runs a coroutine sweep that — with `Time.timeScale = 0` and `AudioListener.pause = true` to freeze spawners/animation/physics so the snapshot stays valid — hides everything outside the current group, samples `Time.unscaledDeltaTime` for N seconds, and ranks each group by added avg/p99 ms vs a baseline measurement. Endpoints: `GET /shader-profile/groups`, `POST /shader-profile/start`, `GET /shader-profile/status`, `GET /shader-profile/result`, `POST /shader-profile/cancel`, `POST /shader-profile/spotlight`. Restoration of renderer states + timeScale + audio pause is done in a `finally` block, on `Cancel`, on error, and on `OnDestroy` so the device is never left in a partially-disabled state. The matching web panel lives in the bottom tabset alongside Console / Script / Watch and offers an automatic "Run Auto Sweep" button plus a per-group "Spotlight" toggle for manual eyeballing.

### Changed
- **Hierarchy children include component types.** `HierarchyService.GetChildren` now emits a `components` array (e.g. `["Transform","Camera","AudioListener"]`) on every child node so the Remote IDE Hierarchy panel can search by component type ("Camera", "Rigidbody") in addition to GameObject name. The web search box gains an inline ✕ clear button (Esc also clears) and a `Match: any | name | type` segmented selector below it — choose the scope explicitly; the choice persists in `localStorage`. Placeholder text and search semantics adapt to the selected mode. Older SDK builds that don't ship the `components` field continue to fall back to name-only matching.

## [1.7.43] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **Snapshots no longer bundle SDK-internal folders.** `FileService.StartZipJob` accepts an `excludeDirPrefixes` query param; the server passes `bugpunch_` for snapshot creation so directories like `bugpunch_uploads`, `bugpunch_crashes`, `bugpunch_picks`, and `bugpunch_snapshots` are skipped. Restores mirror this — `UnzipToDirectory` now takes `preserveDirPrefixes`, and the server's `/restore` route passes the same prefix so `clearFirst` no longer wipes the live upload queue / crash spool. Snapshots taken before this version still restore correctly; they're just larger than they need to be.
- **Recording pill simplified.** Dropped the screenshot button from the floating debug widget on Android (`BugpunchDebugWidget.java`) and iOS (`BugpunchDebugWidget.mm`) — the report flow already grabs context shots automatically, the manual button was redundant. The Tools button now renders an icon (Android: new `toolbox` glyph in `BugpunchToolsActivity.FeatherIcon`; iOS: SF Symbol `wrench.and.screwdriver`) instead of a "Tools" text label, matching the report button's visual weight. Removed the now-orphaned `OnManualScreenshot` / `DrainManualScreenshots` plumbing from `DebugToolsBridge.cs`.

## [1.7.42] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **ANRs now ship logs.** The Android ANR watchdog (`BugpunchCrashHandler.AnrWatchdog.writeAnrReport`) and the iOS ANR writer (`BugpunchCrashHandler.mm` `write_anr_report`) only wrote screenshots + thread stacks to the `.crash` file; the `logs:` field that the native signal handler emits was missing, so the drain had nothing to attach. Both watchdogs now snapshot the rolling log buffer (`BugpunchLogReader.snapshotText` / `[BPLogReader snapshotText]`) into a sibling file and add a `logs:` line. iOS drain at `BugpunchDebugMode.mm` was also updated to read the new field and queue the file as a `text/plain` `logs` attachment alongside the existing screenshot. Crashes already had this — ANRs were the odd one out.

## [1.7.41] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`Bugpunch.RequestHelp()` — new in-game picker (public API).** One call surfaces a modal with three large buttons so the game only has to wire a single "need help?" button: **Record a bug** (enters the existing debug-mode + consent + ring-buffer flow), **Ask for help** (opens the live chat board — see below), **Send feedback** (opens the in-game feedback board). Each row now carries its panel artwork (48pt icon) in the UIToolkit fallback and both native surfaces — PNGs live under `Resources/bugpunch-help-*.png`, `Plugins/iOS/bugpunch-help-*@{,2x,3x}.png`, and `android-src/.../res/drawable/bugpunch_help_*.png`, with a graceful fall-back to the previous coloured accent-dot if a resource is missing.
- **Native RequestHelp picker on Android + iOS.** Routes through `INativeDialog.ShowRequestHelp` (Android `BugpunchReportOverlay.showRequestHelp` — WindowManager overlay matching the welcome card's `#F0222222` / 16dp styling, with system-back + backdrop-tap cancel; iOS `Bugpunch_ShowRequestHelp` in `BugpunchReportOverlay.mm` — custom `UIView` backdrop + card mirroring the existing welcome-card look, with tap-outside cancel). UI Toolkit is the fallback for Editor + standalone platforms. Callback plumbing mirrors the existing `ShowReportWelcome` pattern — Android `UnitySendMessage` through `BugpunchReportCallback` (`OnRequestHelpChoice` / `OnRequestHelpCancel`); iOS `[MonoPInvokeCallback]` function pointers.
- **Feedback board (Canny-style, in-game).** `BugpunchFeedbackBoard` is pure UI Toolkit — three views in one card: searchable vote list, new-feedback submit form, similarity prompt. On submit the SDK calls the server's `/api/feedback/similarity` endpoint; if similarity passes the configured threshold the user is offered a "Vote for that instead" button (with a "Post mine anyway" escape hatch) before creating a duplicate. List pulls from `GET /api/feedback?sort=votes`, votes toggle via `POST /api/feedback/{id}/vote`. All HTTP uses `UnityWebRequest` with `Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}` + `X-Device-Id`.
- **Live chat board (`BugpunchChatBoard`).** "Ask for help" now opens a real threaded chat UI (list ↔ new-thread ↔ thread views) with 5-second polling while a thread is open, auto-mark-read on entry, off-hours banner driven by `GET /api/v1/chat/hours`, and two-tone bubbles (SDK user right/green, QA left/grey with name + timestamp). Routing: the native picker implementations on Android + iOS are thin shells that fire `UnitySendMessage("BugpunchReportCallback", "OnShowChatBoardRequested", "")` — `BugpunchClient` receives the message and shows the C# board, so chat is a single C# surface across all platforms. Server endpoints consumed: `POST /api/v1/chat/threads`, `POST /api/v1/chat/threads/:id/messages`, `GET /api/v1/chat/threads/mine`, `GET /api/v1/chat/threads/:id/messages?since=`, `POST /api/v1/chat/threads/:id/read`, `GET /api/v1/chat/hours`.
- **Chat reply popup heartbeat.** `BugpunchClient` now runs a 30-second `ChatReplyHeartbeat` coroutine that sums `UnreadCount` across `GET /api/v1/chat/threads/mine`. When the sum goes positive AND `SuppressInteractions` is currently `false`, the chat board auto-opens so the player sees the QA reply the moment it's safe to interrupt. A `_chatReplyPopupShown` guard prevents re-opening on every tick; the guard resets when the server reports zero unread.
- **Recording-bar shortcut icons.** While the recording overlay is live, two vector-drawn shortcut buttons stack above the record circle on Android + iOS: a blue speech-bubble (chat) and a green lightbulb (feedback). Taps bounce via `UnitySendMessage` to `ReportOverlayCallback` and open `BugpunchChatBoard.Show()` / `BugpunchFeedbackBoard.Show()`. Icons are drawn with Canvas / CoreGraphics — no new PNG assets.

### Changed
- **`SuppressInteractions` is now ref-counted (BREAKING for direct setters).** The old public setter on `BugpunchClient.SuppressInteractions` has been removed. Use `PushSuppression()` which returns an `IDisposable` — dispose to decrement. Read `SuppressInteractions` (bool) or `SuppressInteractionsCount` (int) to observe depth. This lets multiple systems (cutscenes, tutorials, QA reply popup, directive questions) stack suppression without stomping each other. Internal `SuppressInteractions = true/false` call sites have been migrated to `PushSuppression()` / token disposal.

## [1.7.40] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **IAP sub-asmdef now references the right Unity asmdef name.** v1.7.38 referenced `Unity.Purchasing`, but `com.unity.purchasing` 4.0+ publishes its runtime under `UnityEngine.Purchasing.asmdef` (named to match the namespace). With the wrong name the IAP reference didn't resolve and consumers hit the same `CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Purchasing' does not exist in the namespace 'UnityEngine'` family of errors. Changed the reference to `UnityEngine.Purchasing`.

## [1.7.39] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **PlayerPrefs Windows enumeration no longer needs a `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.dll` asmdef reference.** v1.7.37 added the DLL to `precompiledReferences` but Unity's resolution of that DLL varies by API compatibility level (.NET Framework bakes the types into mscorlib; .NET Standard 2.1 ships them separately and the BCL location differs between Editor and target platforms) — consumer projects kept hitting `CS1069`. `PlayerPrefsService.EnumerateWindows` now reaches `Microsoft.Win32.Registry` via reflection (`Type.GetType` with two probe names), so no compile-time type reference is required. Code path stays behind `#if UNITY_EDITOR_WIN || UNITY_STANDALONE_WIN`, so Windows is still the only place it runs.

## [1.7.38] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Unity IAP integration moved to its own sub-asmdef.** The IAP file at `Purchasing/BugpunchPurchasing.cs` ships under `ODDGames.Bugpunch.Purchasing.asmdef`, gated by `defineConstraints: ["BUGPUNCH_HAS_UNITY_IAP"]` + `versionDefines` on `com.unity.purchasing >= 4.0`. Previously the file lived in the main asmdef and referenced `UnityEngine.Purchasing.*` types with only a `#if` guard — but the main asmdef had `overrideReferences: true` and no reference to `Unity.Purchasing`, so consumers that actually had IAP installed hit `CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Purchasing' does not exist in the namespace 'UnityEngine'` (and 16 similar). The sub-asmdef only compiles when IAP is present and declares the `Unity.Purchasing` reference locally — resolves cleanly when IAP is installed, silently inert otherwise.

## [1.7.37] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **`Microsoft.Win32.Registry` reference restored on the UPM asmdef.** The SDK asmdef uses `overrideReferences: true` and had dropped `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.dll` from `precompiledReferences`, so `PlayerPrefsService.EnumerateWindows()` failed to compile in consumer projects with `CS1069: The type name 'Registry' could not be found in the namespace 'Microsoft.Win32'`. Re-added the reference — it's part of Unity's .NET Standard 2.1 extras and resolves cleanly on Windows Editor + standalone where the code path runs.
- **WebRTC live stream no longer renders the RT every game frame.** `WebRTCStreamer.RenderLoop()` was yielding on `WaitForEndOfFrame` and blitting every single frame regardless of the requested stream fps, so a 60 fps phone driving a 30 fps stream was doing 2× the `Graphics.Blit` / scene-camera `Camera.Render()` work for frames libwebrtc would never encode — which both cooked the device and let frames pile up inside the Unity-WebRTC binding's internal queue on bad networks. The loop now paces video blits via `Time.unscaledTime` against `1f / _fps` and catch-up bursts are clamped (next blit = `max(scheduled, now)`). Metadata sends are separately paced at 10 Hz (down from "every other rendered frame", which scaled with game fps). Net effect on a 60/30 setup: ~50% less streamer work, no added latency when the stream is healthy.

### Changed
- **`/files/zip` is now an async job with real progress.** The previous endpoint blocked the tunnel for the whole zip + base64 round-trip, which ran for minutes on big `persistentDataPath` trees and gave no feedback. Replaced with `/files/zip/start` (returns a `jobId` immediately), `/files/zip/progress?jobId=` (stage + `processedFiles/totalFiles` + `bytesWritten`), and `/files/zip/result?jobId=` (streams the base64 once done). C# version runs on `Task.Run`; Android version runs on a dedicated low-priority executor. `SnapshotsPanel` and `FileBrowserPanel` now show a live progress bar driven by these counters, and the snapshot-creation server route (`POST /api/snapshots`) likewise flipped to a job pattern (`GET /api/snapshots/jobs/:jobId`) so the dashboard never sits on a multi-minute HTTP request. Old `/files/zip` removed — pre-release, no backcompat needed.

## [1.7.36] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **Role model replaces per-feature pin toggles.** The three independent `alwaysLog` / `alwaysRemote` / `alwaysDebug` pins are gone. Each device now carries a single `tester_role` tag: `internal` (ambient log streaming + ambient Remote IDE tunnel accept + startup debug-mode consent prompt), `external` (startup debug-mode consent prompt only), or `public` (crash reporting only — the default for every new device). The server-signed handshake now ships a `roleConfig { role, issuedAt, payload, sig }` instead of `pinConfig`; `BugpunchTunnel` (Android + iOS) parses the role, SharedPreferences / Keychain caches the string, and existing feature gates fan out from `role == "internal"`. Startup debug-mode prompt wiring is a follow-up — `Bugpunch.EnterDebugMode()` still works as a manual entry point. Old server fields (`pinConfig`, `alwaysLog` etc.) are no longer emitted; shipped SDKs expecting them silently degrade to "no ambient features" which is the safe default.
- **SDK C# surface**: `PinState` → `RoleState` (`RoleState.Current`, `RoleState.IsInternal`, `RoleState.IsTester`). `BugpunchNative.PinAlwaysLog/Remote/Debug/PinConsent()` removed; `BugpunchNative.GetTesterRole()` added. `RequestRouter` Remote-IDE gate now `role == internal` on shipped builds (Editor + `Debug.isDebugBuild` still unrestricted).

### Fixed
- **Per-line compile errors in the Remote IDE script panel now render through Monaco's native marker API.** Previously errors only showed a whole-line red tint; they now light up the overview ruler, inline squiggles, hover cards, and the Problems list via `monaco.editor.setModelMarkers`. The script envelope now carries `{line, column, length}` when available so markers underline the exact token; runtime exceptions keep their line info too. Enabled `glyphMargin` so the gutter error-dot actually renders.

## [1.7.35] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Auto-emit `scene_change` analytics event on every scene transition.** `BugpunchSceneTick` now fires a `scene_change` event with `{from, to, duration_ms}` through the existing `Bugpunch.TrackEvent` pipe in addition to pushing the ambient scene name to native. The first activation fires with `from=null` so session-entry scenes are captured as a first-class signal (can't derive "what scene did the user open the app into" from ambient metadata alone). Same-name transitions (additive-load promote → unload sequences firing `activeSceneChanged` with unchanged active name) are suppressed analytically but still update native metadata. Events land in `analytics_events` with `event_name='scene_change'` — queryable for session paths, time-in-scene, and entry-point analytics.

## [1.7.34] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Unity IAP integration — one-line hookup.** If the game has `com.unity.purchasing` 4.0+ installed, wrapping the existing `IStoreListener` with the new `.WithBugpunch()` extension method auto-logs every successful purchase into Bugpunch analytics without duplicating the call inside `ProcessPurchase`. The wrapper is a transparent decorator — game's listener runs first unchanged, then Bugpunch side-channels `{sku, price, currency, transactionId}` to `LogPurchase`. Supports both `IStoreListener` and `IDetailedStoreListener`; forwards both old (reason-only) and new (detailed) failure callbacks. Gated behind a `BUGPUNCH_HAS_UNITY_IAP` version-define on `ODDGames.Bugpunch.asmdef` so the integration file compiles *only* when Unity IAP is present — zero reflection, zero runtime cost when absent, no effect on games that don't use IAP.

## [1.7.33] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Remote IDE stream now matches the device's live aspect ratio.** The WebRTC streamer was allocating a RenderTexture at the raw `width`/`height` sent from the dashboard (all three presets are 16:9: 480×270 / 960×540 / 1920×1080), then blitting the game screen into it with `Graphics.Blit` — so a portrait phone (e.g. 1080×2400) was being squashed into 16:9 and the Remote IDE displayed a distorted, black-barred frame. `WebRTCStreamer` now treats the requested W/H as a **long-edge pixel budget** and derives the actual RT dimensions from `Screen.width`/`Screen.height` every allocation. In scene mode, `SceneCameraService.SetAspect` pushes the dashboard's panel aspect into the streamer via the new `IStreamer.SetTargetAspect(w, h)` hook so the scene camera and the RT stay in lock-step. Quality changes and orientation drift hot-swap the RenderTexture in place via `RTCRtpSender.ReplaceTrack` — no SDP renegotiation, no browser reconnect. The `/webrtc-quality` response now reports `reconnectRequired:false` and the dashboard skips the WebRTCStream remount on quality change.
- **Device rotation no longer wedges the stream aspect.** The render loop now samples `Screen.width/Height` every ~30 frames while in game mode (no panel override active) and triggers a track-preserving resize the moment the aspect drifts — rotating the phone mid-session updates the stream within ~½ second instead of requiring a manual reconnect.

## [1.7.32] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **MediaProjection consent is re-asked every `EnterDebugMode()`.** 1.7.31 remembered a prior denial in SharedPreferences and skipped the OS dialog on subsequent opens. Dropped that short-circuit: each `EnterDebugMode()` call shows the consent dialog again, so a user who tapped Cancel once can still grant full-screen capture later without having to find a "clear denial" setting. The buffer-mode fallback still fires on denial — game surface video only, no further prompts for that session.
- **`BugpunchSurfaceRecorder` moves the RGBA→NV12 conversion to the GPU.** New compute shader at `Resources/BugpunchRgbaToNv12.compute` emits NV12 bytes into a `RWByteAddressBuffer`; `AsyncGPUReadback` then copies the already-converted bytes straight to JNI. Frees ~5% of one CPU core at 15 fps/720p. Falls back to the managed-thread CPU conversion on devices where `SystemInfo.supportsComputeShaders` is false.

## [1.7.31] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Android: Unity-surface fallback when MediaProjection consent is denied.** Previously, tapping "Cancel" on Android's system screen-recording consent dialog left us with no video at all — `BugpunchProjectionRequest` silently finished and `BugpunchRecorder` never started. Now: on denial we remember the refusal in SharedPreferences (`bp_projection_denied_at`) and spin the recorder up in buffer-input mode (`COLOR_FormatYUV420SemiPlanar`). A new `BugpunchSurfaceRecorder` MonoBehaviour on the Unity side mirrors the main camera's rendered output into a `RenderTexture` via a `CommandBuffer.Blit`, reads it back asynchronously through `AsyncGPUReadback` (no render-thread stall), converts RGBA32→NV12 on the managed thread, and pushes frames to the native encoder via `BugpunchNative.QueueVideoFrame`. The encoder, ring buffer, MP4 muxer, and crash-dump path are shared with the MediaProjection source — only the frame producer changed. Bug reports now ship ~15 fps game-only footage even when projection is denied, at ~4–6% CPU overhead. Next session after the denial, `BugpunchDebugMode.enter()` skips the OS dialog entirely via `BugpunchProjectionRequest.wasPreviouslyDenied()` and goes straight to buffer mode — no more repeated prompts.

## [1.7.30] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **`CaptureScreen` no longer spams "attempting to ReadPixels outside of RenderTexture bounds!".** The old path called `ReadPixels(new Rect(0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height), 0, 0)` against whatever RT happened to be bound as active. That raced with the WebRTC render loop, which binds its own 960×540 RT during sampling — so a full-screen ReadPixels (e.g. `2254×…`) overflowed the 960×540 RT and Unity complained every frame. Capture now goes: `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotIntoRenderTexture` into an owned full-size RT → GPU blit (with Y-flip) into a pre-scaled target RT → `ReadPixels` from that known target → CPU JPEG encode. Side benefit: the CPU readback is now of the already-downscaled image (960×540 instead of full screen), so one-shot screenshots are faster too.

## [1.7.29] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Unity Editor reappears in the Devices list after the tunnel split.** 1.7.28 moved the Editor to the managed-only `/api/devices/ide-tunnel`, but the dashboard's `GET /api/devices` was still sourcing its device list from `reportTunnelService.listTunnels()` + DB-poll-registered rows + agent devices — none of which the Editor populates (no native report tunnel, no HTTP register). Result: Editor connected and registered fine server-side but was invisible in the UI. `ideTunnelService` now exposes `listTunnels()`, and the devices route merges ide-tunnel-only connections into the response as `connectionMode: "debug"`. `IdeTunnel`'s register frame picks up `platform` + `appVersion` so Editor rows render with a proper platform badge.
- **Log flush backlog on hot logcat streams.** `BugpunchTunnel.java` could post thousands of `flushLogs` runnables before the worker thread got CPU — one per line once the buffer crossed the 16 KB threshold. The runnable now coalesces: one immediate + at most one delayed flush are in flight at a time. Re-enables `flushLogs` on the native path (the WebRTC debug `if (true) return;` short-circuit is removed).
- **iOS report tunnel now starts on `Bugpunch_StartDebugMode`.** Previously only Android auto-started the tunnel; iOS waited for something external to call `Bugpunch_StartTunnel`. BugpunchNative now calls it right after `StartDebugMode` succeeds.

### Changed
- **Pin config rides the poll path too.** The poll response can now carry a signed `pinConfig`; native applies it to the Keychain / SharedPreferences cache immediately and auto-starts the report tunnel if the device is pinned + consented. Release/internal devices get QA enrollment without waiting for a manual report-tunnel bring-up.
- **`useNativeTunnel` now true for `BuildChannel.Internal` too.** Previously only `Debug.isDebugBuild` / `EditorUserBuildSettings.development` unlocked the native tunnel; internal QA builds without the `development` flag stayed on poll-only. The two config bundlers (runtime + editor) converge on the same rule.
- **Register payload carries `stableDeviceId` + `buildChannel`.** Both Android + iOS poll registration send these now, so the server can reconcile reinstalls and apply channel-based pin policy. `ensureRegistered` refreshes once per process (not just once per installed token) so renamed apps / reissued keys refresh cleanly.
- **build-android.ps1 sets `ANDROID_USER_HOME` + `ANDROID_PREFS_ROOT` into a workspace-local dir.** Sandboxed / CI builds no longer need write access to the OS user profile.

## [1.7.28] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **Remote IDE and bug reporting now ride separate tunnels.** The single `/api/devices/tunnel` WebSocket is split into two: native SDK connects to `/api/devices/report-tunnel` (crashes / bugs / pin config / log sink / device actions), managed C# connects to `/api/devices/ide-tunnel` (hierarchy / inspector / script / webrtc-* / capture / scene-camera). Server-side: `tunnelService.ts` → `reportTunnelService.ts` + new `ideTunnelService.ts`; 10 callers updated. SDK-side: `TunnelClient.cs` → `IdeTunnel.cs` and loses the `#if UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS` platform splits — managed IDE tunnel runs on every platform. `TunnelBridge.cs` deleted (no abstraction needed once the split is clean). Native `BugpunchTunnel.java` / `BugpunchTunnel.mm` drop the `case "request":` request-routing block plus the `UnitySendMessage("OnTunnelRequest")` bridge — the report tunnel no longer carries Remote IDE traffic. Narrow native→C# bridge for queued `run_script` actions stays (`OnScriptAction` + `PostScriptResult`).
- **"Ask user for help" + "Enable debug tunnel on next boot" merged in the dashboard for device-targeted requests.** Single checkbox labelled "Request debug access" — accepting the in-app prompt opens the IDE tunnel on next boot. Crash-group-targeted requests keep the standalone "Ask user for help" semantics.

## [1.7.27] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Unity Editor no longer mis-detects itself as a mobile-native build.** When the Editor's build target was set to Android or iOS, the `#if UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS` preprocessor branches across `BugpunchClient` / `TunnelBridge` / `TunnelClient` / `DeviceIdentity` assumed a native `BugpunchTunnel` was running (it only runs on the real device player, never in the Editor). Result: the Editor never created a managed `TunnelClient`, never opened a WebSocket, never registered — it simply didn't appear on the server's Devices page. All 14 affected conditionals now read `(UNITY_ANDROID || UNITY_IOS) && !UNITY_EDITOR` (or the complementary `|| UNITY_EDITOR` form) so the Editor always uses the managed C# tunnel path regardless of build target.

## [1.7.26] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- **WebRTC streaming reverted to C# / `com.unity.webrtc` on Android.** N7's native `BugpunchStreamer.java` (PixelCopy / MediaProjection → ByteBuffer I420 → `libwebrtc`) is deleted. `/webrtc-*` requests now fall through `BugpunchTunnel` to `BugpunchClient`'s existing `WebRTCStreamer` path (same code used on iOS + Editor). The C# path is 100% GPU (`RenderTexture` → `VideoStreamTrack` → native encoder via Unity's graphics interop), supports camera switching (`SetCamera(Camera)`), a scene-camera mode driven by `SceneCameraService`, and a full game-view capture (including Screen-Space-Overlay UI) via `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotIntoRenderTexture` when no target camera is set. Removed `libs/webrtc-classes.jar` (compile-only dep for the native streamer) and the `InitializeStreamerLazy` Android early-return.

### Added
- **Phase 6c — native log redaction.** `BugpunchConfig.logRedactionRules` is a list of regex patterns (name + pattern). The native tunnel compiles each rule once at startup (`Pattern.compile` on Android, `NSRegularExpression` on iOS) and applies them to every captured log line **before the line enters the batcher** — nothing matching a configured pattern ever leaves the process via the QA log sink. Each match is replaced with `[redacted:NAME]`. Bad patterns are logged and skipped so one typo can't take down the rest of the ruleset.
- **Phase 6b — `PinAuditPopover`.** Admin-only history icon next to `PinToggles` on the Devices page. On click, fetches the device's pin change log and shows who flipped what, when, and an optional reason. Diffs render as short human-readable flags (`alwaysLog on, alwaysDebug off`) with relative timestamps.
- **Phase 6d — `PinPolicyPopover`.** Admin-only shield icon on the Devices page header. Toggles the project's `allowAlwaysDebugOnProduction` flag via `PATCH /api/v1/projects/:id/pin-policy`. Together with the type-to-confirm dialog in `PinToggles`, this gives the project owner the full control loop for the production-channel alwaysDebug pin that Phase 6a unlocked.

## [1.7.24] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Native tunnel N6 — `TunnelClient.IsConnected` and `.DeviceId` now read through to native on device.** `BugpunchNative.TunnelIsConnected()` / `.TunnelDeviceId()` (new JNI + P-Invoke accessors) are the single source of truth; the managed fields back the Editor path only. Every call site that checks `Tunnel.IsConnected` or reads `Tunnel.DeviceId` on a shipped build now sees the real native state instead of the stale managed value that never transitioned out of default (since `TunnelClient.Connect` has been a no-op on device since N3). Full class removal + OnConnected/OnDisconnected re-raising via `UnitySendMessage` is the remaining N6 follow-up.

## [1.7.23] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Native tunnel N3 — request-dispatch bridge.** Incoming Remote IDE `request` frames now arrive on the native WebSocket, are marshaled to C# via `UnityPlayer.UnitySendMessage("[Bugpunch Client]", "OnTunnelRequest", json)`, and the response ships back through `BugpunchNative.TunnelSendResponse`. The existing `RequestRouter` + every Hierarchy / Inspector / Script / SceneCamera / Watch / etc. service stays C# — they need Unity reflection. Only the transport moved.
- **Native tunnel N4 — native pin state.** Pin config (`{pins,consent,issuedAt,sig}`) is parsed + stored natively on both platforms:
  - Android — `SharedPreferences` file `bugpunch_pins`, reloaded on cold start.
  - iOS — Keychain entry `(au.com.oddgames.bugpunch, pin_state_v1)`, survives app reinstall.
  - C# `PinState` delegates to `BugpunchNative.PinAlwaysLog / Remote / Debug / Consent` on device; Editor keeps its PlayerPrefs-backed mirror for local dev flow.
  - HMAC verification of the server signature (`sig` field) against a bundled `pin_signing_secret` is deferred to N4.2 — current path trusts the tunnel (API-key + TLS), same guarantee the managed path had.
- **Native tunnel N5 — native log sink.** When `alwaysLog` is on and consent accepted, the native log readers (`BugpunchLogReader` on Android, `BPLogReader` on iOS) tee every captured line into a per-tunnel batcher (~100 ms / ~32 KB). Batches ship as `{type:"log",sessionId,text}` frames on the same WebSocket. **Zero C# involvement on the log path** — capture + transport are both native. Server-side `logSinkService` appends raw bytes to `data/logs/{sessionId}.log`, inserts the `log_sessions` DB row on first chunk, and finalizes on tunnel disconnect. S3 upload + 50-session-per-device retention are follow-up jobs.

### Changed
- **C# `TunnelClient.Connect` is a no-op on device.** Native `BugpunchTunnel` owns the WebSocket lifecycle end-to-end on Android + iOS. The managed `TunnelClient` still exists so existing call sites compile and the Editor keeps working with its managed ClientWebSocket for local dev; retired fully in a later phase (N6).
- **`TunnelClient.SendResponse` / `SendBinaryResponse`** route responses through `BugpunchNative.TunnelSendResponse` on device. Editor path unchanged.
- **`BugpunchLogReader` (Android)** tees each logcat line into the native sink; the crash-log ring buffer is unchanged.
- **`BPLogReader` (iOS)** tees each OSLog-derived line into the native sink; ring buffer unchanged.

## [1.7.22] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Native WebSocket tunnel — N1 (Android) + N2 (iOS)** of the native-tunnel migration. Replaces the C# `TunnelClient`'s dependence on a live Mono runtime with an OkHttp-backed socket on Android and a `URLSessionWebSocketTask` on iOS. The native tunnel comes up from the ContentProvider (Android) / `+load` bootstrap (iOS) — before Unity's mono runtime is alive — and survives managed crashes because nothing on the path touches the managed heap.
  - `sdk/android-src/bugpunch/src/main/java/au/com/oddgames/bugpunch/BugpunchTunnel.java` — connect + register (with stable device id + build channel) + 10-second heartbeat + exponential-backoff reconnect. Captures the signed pin config from the `registered` ack and live `pinUpdate` frames so the pin enforcement path can read it without further round-trips.
  - `sdk/package/Bugpunch/Plugins/iOS/BugpunchTunnel.mm` — iOS mirror using `NSURLSessionWebSocketDelegate`. Same register payload, same pin-config capture, same backoff. Exposes `Bugpunch_StartTunnel`, `Bugpunch_StopTunnel`, `Bugpunch_TunnelIsConnected`, `Bugpunch_GetLastPinConfig` for the later native pin handler (N4).
  - `sdk/android-src/bugpunch/build.gradle` picks up `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0`; resolved through the project's existing `google()` + `mavenCentral()` repositories.
- **Pin enforcement gate in `RequestRouter`** — interactive Remote IDE requests refuse with 403 on shipped builds unless `PinState.IsAlwaysRemote` is true. Editor + `Debug.isDebugBuild` keep the existing developer UX (no pin required).
- **`PinState` singleton** — receives pin config via `TunnelClient.OnPinConfig`, caches to PlayerPrefs for fast cold-start, exposes `IsAlwaysLog` / `IsAlwaysRemote` / `IsAlwaysDebug` to the rest of the SDK. Interim; to be retired when N4 moves pin handling fully native.

### Changed
- **`BuildChannel` field added to `BugpunchConfig`** (enum: `Internal` / `Beta` / `Production`). Declared per-build in the Inspector; serialised into the bundled config so the server can apply channel-appropriate pin guardrails. Defaults to `Internal`.
- **Tunnel register payload extended** — now includes `stableDeviceId` (Keychain UUID on iOS, `ANDROID_ID` on Android via the new `BugpunchIdentity` helper) and `buildChannel`. Server persists both on the `devices` row so pins survive app reinstalls.
- **Server tunnel handshake** returns a signed pin config (HMAC-SHA256 over `{ pins, consent, issuedAt }` keyed to each project's `pin_signing_secret`) in the `registered` ack, and pushes `pinUpdate` frames live when an admin toggles pins in the dashboard.

## [1.7.21] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Pre-Unity native bootstrap (Android + iOS)** — the Bugpunch SDK now installs crash handlers, the log ring, and the upload-queue drain *before* Unity boots. Previously the SDK waited for a C# `BugpunchNative.Start()` call from `[RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod]`, which meant crashes during Unity's own startup (mono boot, asset load, first-scene init) went uncaught. Now:
  - New Unity editor post-processor `BugpunchConfigBundle` serialises the static parts of `BugpunchConfig` into `bugpunch_config.json` and places it in the APK's `assets/` (Android) or the Xcode main bundle (iOS) at build time.
  - **Android** — new manifest-declared `BugpunchInitProvider` ContentProvider runs before `Application.onCreate()` returns (same pattern Firebase / Sentry use), reads the bundled config, and calls a new `BugpunchRuntime.startEarly(Context, String)` to install signal handlers / log ring / crash paths / upload drain. An `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` bridge captures the first non-Bugpunch Activity and calls the new `BugpunchRuntime.attachActivity(Activity)` to wire up the Activity-bound pieces (overlay detector, SurfaceView cache, Choreographer frame tick, AEI scan, crash drain, shake detector).
  - **iOS** — new `BugpunchBootstrap.mm` uses an Obj-C `+load` method to read `bugpunch_config.json` from the main bundle and call `Bugpunch_StartDebugMode` before `main()` fires.
- **Idempotent config refresh** — both `BugpunchRuntime.start(Activity, String)` and `Bugpunch_StartDebugMode(const char*)` now safely re-run with a richer Unity-runtime config (Application.version, deviceId, persistentDataPath-resolved attachment rules). Config values are merged, crash handler metadata is refreshed, one-time init is skipped. The legacy C# path continues to work unchanged for projects that haven't picked up the new post-processor yet.

## [1.7.20] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **ANR — OS-level Android data** — `BugpunchCrashHandler.scanApplicationExitInfo` (API 30+) now pulls `ActivityManager.getHistoricalProcessExitReasons` at next launch, merges new `REASON_ANR` / `REASON_CRASH_NATIVE` / `REASON_LOW_MEMORY` / etc. into matching on-disk `.crash` files by `(type, timestamp ±30s)`, or synthesizes standalone entries for exits we missed. Delivers the authoritative `/data/anr/traces.txt` blob alongside our in-process report — the two sources together give the richest ANR record available.
- **Main-thread stack sample ring** — `AnrWatchdog` now samples `Thread.getStackTrace()` on the main thread at 10 Hz **only** when the main thread has been missing ticks for ≥1 s (adaptive — zero overhead on healthy frames), and dumps the last 5 s of samples under `---STACK_SAMPLES---` in the ANR report. Shows whether the thread was pinned in one spot the whole hang or progressed through several frames before getting stuck — the #1 question when diagnosing ANRs.
- **Android `mapping.txt` upload** — new `BugpunchMappingUploader` editor post-build hook. When R8/ProGuard minification is enabled, locates the emitted `mapping.txt` (in `symbols.zip` or `Library/Bee/.../outputs/mapping/release/`), uploads it to the server via `POST /api/v1/mappings` keyed by `(bundleId, version, buildCode)`. Piggybacks on `symbolUploadEnabled`. Server retraces obfuscated Java frames in crash / ANR / AEI / stack-sample text at ingest time.
- **`app.buildCode` in crash payloads** — native Java now reads Android `versionCode` from `PackageInfo` at startup and includes it in every crash/exception/feedback report so the server can look up the right mapping.

### Changed
- **`BugpunchDebugMode` split into four focused classes** — the old 1500-line coordinator mixed always-on crash/ANR/exception reporting with opt-in video recording, making it ambiguous whether the SDK was privacy-safe for all users. Now:
  - `BugpunchRuntime` — always-on lifecycle coordinator (crash init, ANR watchdog, AEI scan, log reader, metadata, analytics, frame tick, public accessors). Entry point renamed `startDebugMode` → `start`.
  - `BugpunchCrashDrain` — previous-session `.crash` file drain + payload builder + attachment snapshotting.
  - `BugpunchReportingService` — in-process bug / feedback / exception report building + upload orchestration.
  - `BugpunchDebugMode` (shrunk to ~240 lines) — opt-in video recording coordinator only. `enterDebugMode` → `enter`, `stopDebugMode` → `stop`.
- **C# — `BugpunchNative.StartDebugMode` → `BugpunchNative.Start`** to match the Java rename. JNI `AndroidJavaClass` routing updated throughout.

## [1.7.19] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Native debug-tools button press feedback** — `BugpunchToolsActivity` (Android) and `BugpunchToolsPanel.mm` (iOS) now give instant visual feedback on tap. Android gets a `StateListDrawable` with a darkened pressed state plus an alpha flash; iOS gets a scale-down + dim on touch-down and a "Running…" title flash after click. The callback to Unity fires immediately on touch-up so the game runs the tool with zero added delay — the animation is purely for the user's sake, running in parallel with the click dispatch.

## [1.7.18] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Post-build uploads skipped on `BuildAndRun`** — Unity's `BuildAndRun` pipeline leaves `BuildReport.summary.result == Unknown` when `IPostprocessBuildWithReport` runs; the `Succeeded` marker is only written after the hook returns. The previous `result != Succeeded` check treated `Unknown` as failure, so build artifact + type DB + symbol uploads all silently no-op'd even on successful builds. Now we only bail on explicit `Failed` / `Cancelled` and let the `File.Exists` check on the output path be the authority.

## [1.7.17] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Symbol upload streams through disk** — `BugpunchSymbolUploader` no longer buffers `.so` bytes in the managed heap. Scan pass extracts each zip entry to a temp file and reads only the ELF header + PT_NOTE segment (~1KB) to recover the GNU build-ID. Upload pass builds the multipart body on disk and streams via `UploadHandlerFile`. Peak Editor RAM during symbol upload drops from ~1GB (sum of all `libil2cpp.sym.so` across ABIs) to effectively zero. Temp files cleaned up in a `finally` so failed uploads don't leak.

## [1.7.16] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Symbol upload on by default** — `BugpunchConfig.symbolUploadEnabled` now defaults to `true`. Android IL2CPP builds will upload unstripped `.so` symbols from Unity's `symbols.zip` (requires Player Settings → Publishing Settings → Symbols enabled). Prior default was held off pending server storage + symbolicator RAM work; both are resolved on the Lightsail host (80GB disk, 4GB RAM), so the gate is removed. Crash frames will now resolve to source:line on the dashboard.

## [1.7.15] - 2026-04-19

### Removed
- **Dead OS-level injection code** — dropped `BugpunchTouchRecorder.injectTap / injectSwipe / injectPointer*` (Android Java), `RequestRouter.NativeInjectTap / NativeInjectSwipe / NativeInjectPointer` (C#), and the iOS `BugpunchTouch_InjectTap / InjectSwipe` stubs. All Remote IDE input lives in `InputInjector` (Unity Input System) after the previous release. Touch *recording* paths are unaffected.

## [1.7.14] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **Remote IDE input goes through Unity Input System only** — dropped the Android native `Instrumentation.sendPointerSync` injection from `/input/tap`, `/input/swipe`, `/input/pointer`. WebRTC captures the Unity render texture, not the OS screen, so OS-level touches would land outside what the dashboard can see. Injection now uniformly uses `InputInjector` across Android, iOS, and Editor.
- **`#if ENABLE_INPUT_SYSTEM` guards** on `InjectPointerDown/Move/Up/Cancel` so the code compiles even when a project has only the legacy Input Manager enabled (though injection is a no-op in that configuration).

## [1.7.13] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Pointer lifecycle on iOS + Editor** — `InputInjector.InjectPointerDown/Move/Up/Cancel` use the Unity Input System's `TouchState` (touch devices) and `Mouse` state events (desktop) to hold persistent pointer state across calls. The `/input/pointer` route now routes to this on iOS and Editor builds so the Remote IDE drag / press-and-hold works on every platform.

## [1.7.12] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Pointer lifecycle input injection** (Android) — new `/input/pointer` endpoint accepts `{ action: down|move|up|cancel, x, y }` with persistent per-pointer state in `BugpunchTouchRecorder`. Lets the dashboard drive press-and-hold + drag gestures naturally instead of synthesising whole swipes at mouseup. iOS falls back to the existing tap/swipe primitives.

## [1.7.11] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Don't tear down WebRTC on transient ICE Disconnected** — ICE `Disconnected` is recoverable per the spec; the prior handler eagerly teared the peer connection down on that state, which killed the stream when switching to scene camera (brief main-thread hang tripped ICE keepalives). Now we only clean up on `Failed` / `Closed`.

## [1.7.10] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Scene camera skip-ahead** — if the device-side camera lags more than 15m or 90° behind the dashboard's target (fast drag, teleport, snap), it jumps to within that range before lerping the remainder. Keeps big moves responsive while preserving the smooth feel for small deltas.

## [1.7.9] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **WebRTC bitrate cap** — outgoing video sender now caps at 2.5 Mbps / 30 fps via `RTCRtpSender.SetParameters`. Previously Unity.WebRTC could push 8+ Mbps which collapsed on weak cellular; the cap gives GCC a sane target and keeps quality smooth on mobile links. `WebRTCStreamer.SetVideoMaxBitrate(bps, fps)` exposed for dynamic tuning (dashboard can signal bandwidth changes later).

## [1.7.8] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Looser scene camera lerp** — `LerpSpeed` dropped 12 → 8 so the device-side camera eases into position with a softer trailing feel instead of snapping hard to the dashboard's drag target.

## [1.7.7] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Debug widget: remove elapsed-time counter** — the widget was showing a ticking `0:00` timer, but the recording is a rolling ring buffer, not a session. The number didn't represent anything the user could act on. Widget now shows only the blinking red dot + Report / Screenshot / Tools buttons (Android + iOS).
- **Log inner exception on tunnel connect failure** — surface the wrapped `SocketException` / `AuthenticationException` etc. so mobile-carrier connectivity issues can be diagnosed instead of just seeing the generic `WebSocketException: Unable to connect to the remote server`.

## [1.7.6] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Log connect failures** — surface the actual exception type + message when the tunnel WebSocket fails to connect, instead of firing a silent `OnError` event nobody subscribes to. Makes "stuck retrying" situations (mobile carrier blocking, TLS issues, DNS) diagnosable.

## [1.7.5] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Faster reconnect on network switch** — on app resume (e.g. WiFi↔mobile swap), proactively drop the tunnel socket so `ConnectLoop` reconnects immediately instead of waiting 1–2 min for Android's TCP stack to notice the half-open socket.

## [1.7.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Scene Camera Aspect Ratio Sync** — new `/scene-camera/aspect` endpoint lets the dashboard update the scene camera's aspect ratio when the panel resizes, keeping game and scene views properly framed.

## [1.7.3] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Live Touch Overlay** — native OS touch data streamed via WebRTC data channel for real-time visualization in Remote IDE. Shows finger circles with swipe tails, frame-synced to the video stream.
- **Native Touch Injection (Android)** — tap and swipe commands from the dashboard inject at the OS level via `Instrumentation.sendPointerSync`, captured by the native touch recorder for round-trip visualization.
- **`/input/touches` endpoint** — poll native touch state via tunnel proxy (Android JNI, iOS P/Invoke, Editor mouse fallback).

## [1.7.2] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **PlayerPrefs Service** — enumerate, read, edit, and delete PlayerPrefs from Remote IDE. Platform-specific key discovery: Windows registry, Android XML, macOS plist.
- **Memory Snapshot Service** — trigger Unity Memory Profiler snapshots on-device, download .snap files for analysis in Unity's Memory Profiler window. Live memory stats with asset breakdown (textures, meshes, audio, animation, materials).

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Scene Camera Smooth Lerp** — scene camera now smoothly interpolates toward target position/rotation instead of snapping.
- **Watch Service** — live variable watching: search, pin, poll values, apply changes from Remote IDE.
- **Texture Service** — browse, thumbnail, and full-size capture of in-game textures.
- **Material Service** — browse materials, view shader properties, preview textures.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Scene Camera Collider Streaming** — Remote IDE scene camera overlay now streams actual collider geometry (box, sphere, capsule, mesh) instead of renderer bounding boxes. Colliders load progressively near-to-far via Physics.OverlapSphere.
- **Tiered Transform Updates** — dynamic rigidbody colliders update at 150ms, kinematic at 500ms, static colliders sent once. Transform-only polls are lightweight (7 numbers per object).
- **Debug Tools Bridge** — new DebugToolsBridge, DebugToolAttributes for in-game debug tool registration and native debug widget (Android BugpunchToolsActivity, iOS BugpunchToolsPanel).
- **iOS Backbuffer Capture** — new BugpunchBackbuffer.mm for Metal backbuffer screenshot path.

### Changed
- **Inspector Service** — improvements to component inspection.
- **Script Runner** — updates to script execution service.
- **Crash Handler** — Android crash handler improvements, iOS crash handler updates.
- **Report Form** — updated native bug report form (Android BugpunchReportActivity, iOS BugpunchReportForm).
- **Uploader** — Android and iOS uploader improvements.
- **Exception Forwarding** — updated UnityExceptionForwarder.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Game Config Variables** — new `Bugpunch.GetVariable`, `GetVariableBool`, `GetVariableInt`, `GetVariableFloat` API. Variables are fetched from the server on startup with device-matched overrides (GPU, memory, screen size, platform) automatically resolved.
- **Native Performance Monitor** — new `BugpunchPerfMonitor` on Android (Java) and iOS (Obj-C). Enabled via server config, samples FPS and memory natively on a background thread, fires perf events on memory pressure or sustained low FPS.
- **ANR Screenshots** — Android ANR reports now include a screenshot captured via PixelCopy from a cached SurfaceView (works even with the main thread stuck).
- **iOS Log Push** — Unity `Debug.Log` entries are now pushed to the native iOS log buffer via P/Invoke. Android already captures these via logcat.
- **Installer Mode Detection** — Android and iOS detect store/testflight/sideload at startup, included in crash metadata and device registration.

### Changed
- **ANR Cooldown** — 60s cooldown between ANR reports to prevent duplicate firing during a single hang.
- **Crash Category Field** — crash payloads now include a `category` field (`crash`/`anr`) for server-side Issues page tab routing.

## [1.5.23] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Startup log buffer raised to 2000** — matches the ring buffer size so the full boot sequence is captured even on noisy devices.

## [1.5.22] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Log buffer 500 → 2000** — native log ring buffer on both Android and iOS now keeps 2000 entries (was 500). Since crash collection is budgeted to 10 per fingerprint per version, larger buffers have negligible bandwidth impact.
- **Gzip log compression** — logs are now gzip'd and sent as a separate multipart file instead of embedded in the metadata JSON. Reduces upload size ~5×.
- **Startup log preservation** — first 200 log entries are kept in a permanent buffer that's never evicted. When entries between startup and recent are dropped, a "--- N log entries omitted ---" breaker is inserted so you always see how the app started.
- **SDK-level log dedup** — consecutive identical log messages (same level + tag + message) are collapsed into a single entry with a `repeat` count. Eliminates buffer-wasting spam (e.g. Vulkan per-frame logs).
- **iOS startup log lookback** — OSLogStore now queries 60 seconds before init on its first poll, capturing logs written before BugpunchDebugMode started.

### Fixed
- **Android AAR local build** — `build.gradle` updated for local build with Unity's bundled SDK/NDK (compileSdk 36, build-tools 36, Java 11 source compat, `ndkPath` instead of env-only).

## [1.5.21] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **iOS Xcode build break in v1.5.20** — `extern "C"` declarations are only valid at file scope in Objective-C++; the v1.5.20 fix put one inside a method body, which clang rejects with `expected unqualified-id`. Hoisted the forward declaration of `BPDirectives_OnUploadResponse` to the top of `BugpunchUploader.mm`. Downstream games on v1.5.20 will fail to archive — upgrade to v1.5.21.

## [1.5.20] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **iOS link error** — `BPDirectives_OnUploadResponse` forward declaration in `BugpunchUploader.mm` now uses `extern "C"` so Obj-C++ matches the C symbol defined in `BugpunchDirectives.mm`. Without this, crash upload responses fail to dispatch directives on iOS builds.

## [1.5.19] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **"Request More Info" crash directives** — QA can queue per-fingerprint data-gathering from the dashboard. Three action types: `attach_files` (native glob within a game-declared allow-list), `run_script` (runtime diagnostics via the IL2CPP-safe script runner), and `ask_user_for_help` (friendly post-upload consent dialog that auto-enables debug mode on accept and persists "never ask again" per fingerprint on decline). Directive output is POSTed to `/api/crashes/events/:id/enrich` via the existing retry/app-kill-resistant upload queue. Script failures file a companion `DirectiveError:Script` event under the same crash group so they surface in the issue detail.
- **`BugpunchConfig.attachmentRules[]`** — Inspector-editable allow-list of files Bugpunch is permitted to read. Server directives can only reference paths that match a rule here, so games stay in control of what leaves the device. Supports Unity path tokens `[PersistentDataPath]`, `[TemporaryCachePath]`, `[DataPath]`.
- **`Bugpunch.AddAttachmentRule(name, path, pattern, maxBytes)`** — runtime escape hatch for dynamic attachment paths; merged with config rules at startup.
- **Per-(fingerprint, appVersion) sample budget** — crash group `SampleCountByVersion` tracks collection quota per app version so a v2.0 regression can't be masked by v1.x having already exhausted the global counter.

### Changed
- **Android plugin now ships as a pre-built AAR.** Source moved from `package/Bugpunch/Plugins/Android/BugpunchPlugin.androidlib/` (which forced end-game builds to run Gradle + NDK) to `android-src/bugpunch/` (outside the UPM package). CI rebuilds `BugpunchPlugin.aar` on every push to `main` touching `android-src/**` and commits it back. Downstream games consume only the AAR — no JDK / Android SDK / NDK required during their player build. Local rebuild via `sdk/build-android.ps1` for devs with the toolchain; iOS stays as source (Xcode compiles per player build).
- **Directive dispatch is native-heavy.** C# shrunk to one managed-only concern (script execution, which requires the Mono/IL2CPP runtime). Native owns upload-response parsing, fingerprint matching, file globs, consent dialogs, and per-fingerprint denial prefs on both Android (`BugpunchDirectives.java` + `SharedPreferences`) and iOS (`BugpunchDirectives.mm` + `NSUserDefaults`).

## [1.5.18] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **iOS build error — `use of undeclared identifier 'BPOverlayActions'`** — `BugpunchReportOverlay.mm` referenced the class via `[BPOverlayActions class]` inside the C-linkage setup functions, but its `@interface` sat at the bottom of the file. Moved the interface to the top (implementation stays near its helpers) so clang sees the declaration before the usages.
- **Android CMake path-length warning on deep Jenkins workspaces** — `CMakeFiles/bugpunch_crash.dir/bugpunch_crash.c.o` pushed the object path to 243/250 chars on `C:/jenkinsagents/.../MTD/...`, risking a silent build failure. Renamed the native source to `bp.c` and the CMake target to `bp`; `OUTPUT_NAME bugpunch_crash` preserves `libbugpunch_crash.so` so `System.loadLibrary("bugpunch_crash")` still works unchanged.

## [1.5.17] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **False ANR detections every 5s after the native-first C# refactor** — the Android ANR watchdog relied on `BugpunchCrashHandler.tickWatchdog()` being called from the C# `Update()` loop. The refactor to `UnityExceptionForwarder` (static, no MonoBehaviour) removed that tick, so the watchdog thought the main thread was permanently stuck and wrote a new ANR crash file every 5s. Replaced with a self-tick `Runnable` posted to Android's main `Handler` every 1s — if the main thread is healthy it runs and updates the timestamp; if it's genuinely stuck the ticks stop and the watchdog fires a real ANR. No C# coordination required.

## [1.5.16] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **iOS build failure** — `Bugpunch_EnqueueReport` called `Bugpunch_EnqueueReportWithTraces` before its definition appeared in the translation unit. Added a forward declaration inside the `extern "C"` block so clang sees both symbols. No functional change.

## [1.5.15] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **`Bugpunch.Trace(label)` / `Bugpunch.Trace(label, tags)`** — mark a moment in the session with a label + optional string tags dict. Queued in a bounded ring buffer (max 50); all accumulated events ship with the next bug report as a `traces` multipart field.
- **`Bugpunch.TraceScreenshot(label)` / `TraceScreenshot(label, tags)`** — same as Trace but also captures a screenshot at call time (native `PixelCopy` on Android, `drawViewHierarchyInRect` on iOS) and attaches it as a separate `trace_N.jpg` multipart part. Server exposes these as `TraceMarker` Parse rows linked to the bug report; dashboard renders them in a timeline with thumbnails.
- **`autoStart` flag on `BugpunchConfig`** — when false, the client won't auto-connect and the game must call `BugpunchClient.StartConnection()` manually (e.g. behind a debug-build feature toggle).

### Changed
- **Bug report uploader signature grew optional trace params** — existing `BugpunchUploader.enqueue(...)` 7-arg overload kept for backwards compat. New 9-arg overload (Java) / `Bugpunch_EnqueueReportWithTraces` (iOS) carry the traces JSON path + per-trace screenshot paths.

## [1.5.14] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **CMake path not found** — `externalNativeBuild { cmake.path '../jni/CMakeLists.txt' }` resolved to `unityLibrary/jni/` in Unity's generated Gradle project, which doesn't exist (the `jni/` sibling folder wasn't copied). Moved the NDK source into the androidlib at `src/main/cpp/` so Unity copies it alongside the Java sources; updated `cmake.path` to `src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.
- **AGP `ndkVersion` / `ndkPath` mismatch** — read the actual version from Unity's bundled NDK `source.properties` and set `ndkVersion` to match `ndkPath`, avoiding [CXX1100].
- **Type database uploaded on failed Player builds** — dropped the `compilationFinished` trigger which fired on every Editor recompile (including the cascade after a failed build). TypeDB now only uploads on successful post-build and on client-connect during play mode.

## [1.5.13] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **AGP still checked NDK license by version** even when matching `unityLibrary.ndkVersion` — Unity's bundled NDK isn't registered as a managed SDK package, so AGP thinks it needs to install it. Switched to `ndkPath` (from `unityLibrary.ndkPath` or `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`) which points Gradle straight at Unity's bundled NDK and bypasses the license check entirely.

## [1.5.12] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **AGP demanded NDK 27.0.12077973 license not accepted** when building the native `.so`. The androidlib Gradle config now inherits `ndkVersion` from Unity's `:unityLibrary` (already installed + licensed in the Unity Hub SDK tree).

## [1.5.11] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **`libbugpunch_crash.so` not found at runtime** — the androidlib Gradle config never included `externalNativeBuild`, so the NDK `.c` file in `Plugins/Android/jni/` was never compiled into a `.so`. Added `externalNativeBuild { cmake { path '../jni/CMakeLists.txt' } }` to `BugpunchPlugin.androidlib/build.gradle` plus `ndk.abiFilters` for `arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a`. Native POSIX signal handlers (SIGABRT / SIGSEGV / SIGBUS / SIGFPE / SIGILL) now actually install at startup instead of failing silently with `dlopen failed`.

## [1.5.10] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **`MPEG4Writer Stop() called but track is not started`** still fired in v1.5.9 because `muxer.release()` internally stops the muxer when it was started without samples. `BugpunchRecorder.dump` now pre-counts real (non-codec-config) samples BEFORE opening the `MediaMuxer`. If zero, it logs the reason and returns false — no muxer instantiation, no framework warning, no 0-byte MP4.

## [1.5.9] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Screenshot captured the report form instead of the game** — `BugpunchScreenshot.capture` was async (PixelCopy fires on a HandlerThread); `BugpunchReportActivity.launch` fired in the same instant, covering Unity before the copy ran. New `captureThen(path, quality, Runnable)` chains the form launch into the PixelCopy completion callback so the screenshot is of the actual game state.
- **Empty/0-byte video MP4** — `BugpunchRecorder.dump` now counts media samples written and returns false when only codec-config samples were in the buffer (recorder hadn't captured a real frame yet). Eliminates `MPEG4Writer Stop() called but track is not started` warnings and prevents uploading invalid MP4s.
- **`dumpRingIfRunning` verifies file size** after dump — logs clearly whether the video was attached (`video dump ok: … (N bytes)`) or skipped (`no video dump — recorder not running`), deletes zero-byte files.
- **Nav bar covering annotate + report form buttons** — bottom toolbar (Annotate) and form Send/Cancel (Report) applied `setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` to pad above system bars. Required on Android 15+ which is edge-to-edge regardless of theme. Activities switched from `Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen` to `Theme.NoTitleBar`.

### Changed
- **Dashboard media layout** — screenshot constrained to `max-w-md` (no longer stretches full panel width); 2-column layout on `md+`; placeholder card when no video is attached explaining *why* ("Tester didn't tap Enter Debug before reporting, or recorder hadn't captured a keyframe yet").

## [1.5.8] - 2026-04-15

Major refactor: **native-first architecture**. Everything that doesn't strictly need Unity now lives in Java/Obj-C++; C# is a thin adapter (4 files: facade, JNI/P-Invoke bridge, scene tick, managed-exception forwarder). Survives a dying Mono runtime, owns a persistent retry queue across launches, no Unity dep on the crash path.

### Added
- **`Bugpunch.EnterDebugMode(bool skipConsent = false)`** — opt-in screen recording. Default shows a custom native consent sheet (Start Recording / Cancel) over a blurred backdrop. `skipConsent: true` for debug/alpha builds. Android still shows OS-level MediaProjection consent; that's mandatory.
- **`Bugpunch.Report(title, description, type)`** — opens a native bug-report form (screenshot preview, email, description, severity dropdown, Send/Cancel). Tap the screenshot to open a fullscreen annotation canvas (pen, undo, clear) — annotations submit as a transparent PNG layer the dashboard can toggle.
- **`Bugpunch.Feedback(message)`**, **`Bugpunch.SetCustomData(k, v)`**, **`Bugpunch.ClearCustomData(k)`** — facade methods.
- **Native log capture** — Android tails its own logcat (own-app filter automatic on API 25+), iOS reads `OSLogStore` (iOS 15+). Bounded ring buffer, snapshotted into report metadata at send time.
- **Native shake detection** — `SensorManager` (Android) / `CoreMotion` (iOS). Disabled by default; flip `shake.enabled` in config to opt in.
- **Native screenshot** — Android `PixelCopy` on Unity's `SurfaceView`, iOS `drawViewHierarchyInRect` on key `UIWindow`. No permissions, no user prompt.
- **Native upload queue** — disk-backed manifest queue at `{cacheDir}/bugpunch_uploads/`. Multipart POST via `HttpURLConnection` (Android) / `NSURLSession` (iOS). Retry up to 10 attempts across app launches; terminal HTTP statuses (400/401/403) drop immediately.
- **Native FPS** — `Choreographer` (Android) / `CADisplayLink` (iOS). C# no longer pushes fps.
- **Bugpunch logo PNG assets** — bundled at multiple densities for Android (`drawable/`) and iOS (`@1x`/`@2x`/`@3x`). Currently unused in dialogs but ready for future UI.
- **Concurrent-report guard** — second `Bugpunch.Report()` while the form is open is ignored (logged, returns silently).

### Changed
- **C# surface shrunk to 4 files**: `Bugpunch.cs`, `BugpunchNative.cs` (+ `BugpunchSceneTick`), `UnityExceptionForwarder.cs`, plus the `BugpunchClient.Setup()` startup hook.
- **`UnityExceptionForwarder`** (was `NativeCrashHandler`) is no longer a `MonoBehaviour` — static, hooks `AppDomain.UnhandledException` + `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` and forwards directly to `BugpunchNative.ReportBug("exception", …)`.
- **Crash endpoint** corrected from `/api/reports/crash` (didn't exist server-side) to `/api/crashes`. Crash JSON now matches `crashService.ingestCrash` shape.
- **Wire format** is now `multipart/form-data` for all reports: `metadata` text field + `screenshot.jpg` / `video.mp4` / `annotations.png` file parts. Server middleware accepts both new multipart and legacy JSON.
- **Editor is now a no-op** — no in-editor send path; device-only.

### Fixed
- **Android 14+ MediaProjection crash** — `MediaProjection.Callback` is now registered via `registerCallback()` before `createVirtualDisplay`. Required by API 34; previously threw `IllegalStateException`.
- **Activity not declared** — `BugpunchReportActivity` and `BugpunchAnnotateActivity` added to `AndroidManifest.xml`.
- **Android Java compile** — three new files (`BugpunchDebugMode`, `BugpunchReportActivity`, `BugpunchScreenshot`) were importing `com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer` directly. Replaced with the existing reflection helper pattern (`BugpunchUnity.currentActivity()` + `BugpunchUnity.sendMessage()`).
- **Test scene buttons unresponsive** — `DebugModeButton.cs` now spawns an `EventSystem` + `InputSystemUIInputModule` if the scene doesn't already have one.

### Removed
- `BugReporter.cs`, `NativeScreenshot.cs`, `BugpunchUpload.cs`, `NativeCrashHandler.cs` — all replaced by the native coordinator + thin C# adapter.
- `Bugpunch.RecordBug()` / `Bugpunch.QuickReport()` — replaced by `Bugpunch.Report()`.

## [1.5.7] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Simplified static API** — `ODDGames.Bugpunch.Bugpunch` facade: `Bugpunch.RecordBug()`, `Bugpunch.QuickReport()`, `Bugpunch.Feedback()`, etc. Replaces deep `BugpunchClient.Instance.Reporter.StartReport()` calls.
- **Record-and-report flow** — friendly native welcome card ("We'll record your screen...") followed by a floating draggable red report button. Button stays for the whole session; shake/F12/`Bugpunch.RecordBug()` all trigger the flow.
- **Native overlay UIs** — new `BugpunchReportOverlay.java` (Android `WindowManager` views) and `BugpunchReportOverlay.mm` (iOS `UIView` on root window) with vector-drawn camera + video icons.

### Fixed
- **Android build failure** — `BugpunchReportOverlay.java` was importing `com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer` directly. The `.androidlib` doesn't have Unity on the classpath, so this broke Gradle compile. Replaced with reflection-based `UnitySendMessage` call (same pattern as `BugpunchCrashActivity` and `BugpunchProjectionRequest`).

## [1.5.6] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **iOS linker error — 25 duplicate symbols** — `ODDRecorderMac.mm` was being included in iOS Xcode exports despite `.meta` restricting it to Standalone. Added `#if TARGET_OS_OSX` guard so it compiles to nothing on iOS. The `ODDRecorderImpl` class is already provided by `ODDRecorder.mm` on iOS.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **iOS build error (Xcode 16.2 / iOS 18.2 SDK)** — renamed `VTCompressionOutputCallback` to avoid name collision with VideoToolbox SDK typedef. Fixed incorrect `CFMutableDictionaryRef` cast of `CMSampleBufferGetSampleAttachmentsArray` return (should be `CFArrayRef`). Added missing `#include <unistd.h>` for `usleep()`.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Android build failure** — `.androidlib/build.gradle` now inherits `buildToolsVersion` from `unityLibrary` in addition to `compileSdkVersion`. Prevents Gradle from trying to download missing build-tools from a read-only SDK location.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Android build failure** — `.androidlib/build.gradle` now inherits `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, and `targetSdkVersion` from Unity's `unityLibrary` project (same pattern as OneSignal). Fixes `compileSdkVersion is not specified` Gradle error.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **iOS build error** — added forward declaration of `handleEncodedSampleBuffer:` in BugpunchRingRecorder.mm to fix compile error in Objective-C++ mode (Xcode 16.2)
- **WebRTC black screen** — game view now uses `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotIntoRenderTexture` to capture exactly what's on screen (all cameras, UI, post-fx). Fixes multi-camera setups where Camera.main was a UI overlay.
- **WebRTC stream killed on scene switch** — `SetCamera` no longer calls `StopStreaming()`. One persistent stream, camera just swaps.
- **Scene camera stop returns to game view** — `SetCamera(null)` instead of `SetCamera(Camera.main)` which was incorrectly selecting the UICamera.
- **ProGuard consumer rules** — added `build.gradle` + `consumer-proguard.pro` to `.androidlib` so R8 keeps `org.webrtc.**` classes automatically in consumer projects (fixes `ClassNotFoundException` in release builds).
- **WebRTC `webrtc-stop` handling** — ignored during streaming to prevent dashboard mode switches from killing the connection.
- **Scene camera orientation** — all 6 snap directions corrected.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- **Android manifest merging** — moved Java plugins + manifest into `BugpunchPlugin.androidlib/` structure (same pattern as Google Ads, Firebase). Fixes `ActivityNotFoundException` for `BugpunchProjectionRequest` and `BugpunchCrashActivity`.
- **WebRTC on Android IL2CPP** — removed separate asmdef approach (stripped by IL2CPP). WebRTCStreamer now in main assembly with direct `AddComponent<WebRTCStreamer>()` in try/catch. Added `link.xml` preserve rules.
- **Scene camera orientation** — all 6 snap directions were inverted, now correct.
- **WebRTC shutdown crash** — skip cleanup during `OnApplicationQuit`.
- **ProGuard stripping** — added `proguard-bugpunch.txt` keeping `org.webrtc.**` Java classes.
- **Plugin .meta files** — 12 files fixed with correct `PluginImporter` platform restrictions.

### Added
- **`SuppressDebugRequests`** — games can block debug session prompts during gameplay.
- **`EnableVideoCapture()`** — video ring buffer is now opt-in, not auto-starting.
- **Scene camera viewport sizing** — renders at dashboard panel dimensions, not device screen.
- **`IStreamer` interface** — decouples BugpunchClient from WebRTCStreamer concrete type.

### Changed
- **Lazy WebRTC loading** — WebRTC only initializes on first `webrtc-offer` from dashboard, not at startup or WebSocket connect.
- **Debug builds use WebSocket directly** — release builds poll, debug builds connect immediately.
- **Simplified BugpunchConfig** — just `serverUrl` + `apiKey`, removed `projectId` and feature toggles.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Production crash reporting** — all-user crash reporting comparable to Instabug/Bugsee/Sentry
- **Native crash handlers** — POSIX signal handlers (SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL) on Android (NDK) and iOS (Mach exceptions). Async-signal-safe, writes crash file to disk, uploads on next launch.
- **ANR detection** — watchdog timer on Android detects main thread hangs, captures all thread stacks
- **C# exception handlers** — `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException` and `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` for exceptions that bypass Unity's log system
- **Native crash overlay** — full-screen Activity (Android) / ViewController (iOS) / IMGUI (desktop) with video playback, stack trace display, user input fields for title/description/severity
- **iOS ring buffer recorder** — always-on H.264 circular buffer using ReplayKit + VideoToolbox, matching the existing Android implementation. 30s window, hardware-accelerated, minimal CPU impact.
- **Unified RingBufferRecorder** — cross-platform C# bridge replacing Android-only `AndroidScreenRecorder`
- **NativeCrashHandler** — C# bridge integrating all native handlers, crash file format (`BUGPUNCH_CRASH_V1`), next-launch detection and upload

### Fixed
- **WebRTC track disposal ordering** — video track now removed from peer connection before disposal, preventing native crashes
- **WebRTC RenderTexture lifecycle** — changing camera mid-stream now safely stops streaming instead of replacing RT while track references it
- **WebRTC.Update() coroutine lifecycle** — guard against multiple coroutine instances, proper cleanup on destroy
- **WebRTC connection state cleanup** — disconnected/failed connections now clean up resources on main thread
- **WebRTC Camera.main caching** — render loop no longer calls Camera.main every frame
- **WebRTC data channel disposal** — explicit Dispose() after Close()
- **WebRTC offer timeout** — 30s deadline prevents hanging on malformed SDP
- **WebRTC dead code** — removed unused HandleAnswer method

### Changed
- **Crash overlay wired to BugReporter** — `INativeDialog.ShowCrashReport()` now callable with exception context + video path
- **`_streaming` flag is volatile** — thread-safe for WebRTC connection state callbacks

### Removed
- **Standalone recorder package** — `au.com.oddgames.recorder` removed, all code already merged into Bugpunch SDK. Eliminates duplicate `ODDRecorderImpl` symbols on iOS builds.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Android 15 crash on startup** — Updated `com.unity.webrtc` from `3.0.0-pre.7` to `3.0.0` (stable). The pre.7 native library (`libwebrtc.so`) called `abort()` during `JNI_OnLoad` on Android 15 (API 35) devices due to missing 16KB page size support. Fixes SIGABRT crash that prevented apps from launching on Honor and other Android 15 devices.

### Changed
- **Minimum Unity version raised to 6000.0** — Required by `com.unity.webrtc` 3.0.0.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Native plugin platform conflicts** — `ODDRecorder.h` headers in iOS/Windows had `DefaultImporter` (no platform restriction), causing Android build collisions. `ODDRecorderMac.mm` lacked explicit iOS/Android exclusions, causing duplicate `ODDRecorderImpl` symbols on iOS builds. All native plugin `.meta` files now have correct `PluginImporter` entries with explicit platform targets and exclusions.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- **Removed `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` file-level gates** — All SDK classes (InputInjector, ActionExecutor, Search, ElementFinder, ActionParser, UIUtility, InputVisualizer, GeminiTestClient, GeminiTestRunner, TestReport) are now compiled unconditionally. Only `UIAutomationTestFixture` (genuine NUnit base class) retains the gate. Replaced NUnit `AssertionException` with `BugpunchTestFailureException` and gated TestReport's NUnit `TestContext` usage inline.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **TypeDB upload is gzipped** — `TypeDatabaseExporter` now gzips the JSON before upload (~10× smaller on the wire) and sends metadata (`X-Unity-Version`, `X-App-Version`, `X-Type-Count`, `X-Namespace-Count`) via headers. Storage format on the server is now `typedb.json.gz`.
- **TypeDB auto-uploads on compile and connect** — `BuildHooks` now uploads the TypeDB after every script compilation (debounced by SHA1 content hash stored in `EditorPrefs` — unchanged content skips the upload) and also whenever `BugpunchClient` connects via the new `OnAnyConnected` static event. Remote IDE IntelliSense stays fresh without manual exports or builds.
- **New `ExportAndUploadIfChanged()` API** — cheap to call from hot paths; the menu item `ODD Games → Export Type Database` still forces a full upload.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **WebRTC camera metadata data channel** — `WebRTCStreamer` now creates an `RTCDataChannel` ("camera-metadata") alongside the video track and sends scene camera pose (`px/py/pz/rx/ry/rz`) every other frame. Lets the web dashboard overlay world-space gizmos that stay aligned with the streamed view.
- **`/resolve-element-type` route** — `RequestRouter` exposes `InspectorService.ResolveElementType` for the Remote IDE to resolve the element type of a collection/array chain (e.g. `transform.GetComponentsInChildren<Renderer>()` → `Renderer`).
- **Generic type args in member chain resolution** — `InspectorService.ResolveChain` now parses `Foo.FindFirstObjectByType<Renderer>` and resolves to `Renderer`, so IntelliSense works on generic method calls.

### Changed
- **Inspector member enumeration includes inherited members** — properties, fields, and methods now use `BindingFlags.FlattenHierarchy`, deduped by name so overrides don't appear twice. Methods are grouped by name with an overload count (`(+N overloads)`) instead of listing every signature.
- **Script errors carry line numbers** — `ScriptRunner` returns structured `{line, message}` entries from the script engine's diagnostics instead of a single blob string, so the script panel can underline the offending line.

### Fixed
- **Missing Android Plugins .meta files** — v1.4.0 shipped `BugpunchProjectionRequest.java`, `BugpunchProjectionService.java`, `BugpunchRecorder.java`, and `AndroidManifest.xml` without their folder `.meta` companions, so Unity dropped the entire `Plugins/Android` tree on package import in consumer projects.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **`GeminiTestRunner` preprocessor errors in projects without test framework** — the file is wrapped in `#if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`, and the C# preprocessor scans skipped regions for `#` directives without parsing string literals. The `SystemPrompt` verbatim string contained markdown headings (`##`, `###`) at line start, which Roslyn treated as invalid preprocessor directives and failed with CS1024 in consumer projects that don't define `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`. Replaced the `##`/`###` line prefixes with `==`/`--` so they no longer look like directives.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Missing `AndroidScreenRecorder.cs.meta`** — v1.4.0 shipped the new `AndroidScreenRecorder.cs` without its Unity meta file, so consuming projects hit `CS0246: AndroidScreenRecorder not found` in `BugReporter.cs` when importing the git package. Unity skips .cs files without a .meta companion during package import.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Native Android screen recorder** — `BugpunchRecorder.java` (MediaCodec + MediaProjection + MediaMuxer) maintains a rolling 30-second ring buffer of encoded H.264 samples on the native side. On uncaught exception, `BugReporter` dumps a trimmed MP4 (starting at the oldest keyframe within the window) and POSTs it with the crash report. Replaces the old Unity-side JPEG frame capture.
- **Auto bug reports on exceptions** — `BugReporter.autoReportExceptions` (default on). When a `LogType.Exception` is logged, a report is filed automatically with a configurable cooldown (`autoReportCooldownSeconds`, default 30s) to prevent flooding on tight exception loops.
- **`BugpunchProjectionService`** — foreground service of type `mediaProjection`, required by Android 10+ to hold the MediaProjection token.
- **`BugpunchClient.StartConnection()`** — static opt-in entry point for release builds. Auto-init is now gated on `Debug.isDebugBuild || Application.isEditor`; release builds must call this explicitly.
- **HTTP POST bug report path** — `BugReporter` now POSTs to `/api/reports/bug` via `UnityWebRequest` with `X-Api-Key` auth. Works even when the live tunnel isn't connected, so crash reports ship from production players with no debug session open.

### Changed
- **`BugReporter` video config** — old `videoScale` + `videoQuality` replaced with `videoBitrate` (H.264 bps) and `videoMaxDimension` (cap on the shorter screen axis). Default video FPS raised from 10 → 30 now that encoding is hardware-accelerated.
- **`BugReporter.OnLog` is thread-safe** — `Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded` can fire on worker threads, so the log timestamp now uses `Stopwatch` instead of `Time.realtimeSinceStartup` (which is main-thread only).
- **Bug reports are deduped server-side** — the server collapses identical stacks (hashed on title + first stack frame) within a 1-hour window, so a buggy release doesn't flood Parse with thousands of duplicate rows.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Version bump to invalidate stale Unity package cache** — CI builds were failing with CS0246 (`VideoTimestampTracker` not found) because the v1.3.1 tag was force-updated after initial creation, and Unity's global git package cache retained the old resolution missing the `.meta` file.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Video timestamp sidecar (`video_timestamps.csv`)** — Per-game-frame session timestamps captured during video recording via `VideoTimestampTracker`. Enables accurate video-to-log synchronization even when the encoder drops frames or stalls.
- **`videoStartOffset` in session JSON** — Seconds between session start and recording start, used by the web viewer to map between session timeline and video playback position.
- **`videoTimestampsFile` in session JSON** — Reference to the sidecar CSV filename in the diagnostic zip.

### Changed
- **Web viewer video sync uses offset mapping** — `VideoPanel` now maps between session time and video time via `sessionToVideo()`/`videoToSession()` functions instead of assuming 1:1 alignment. Correctly handles recordings that start after the session begins and detects when the timeline position is past video coverage.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **`HierarchyNode.instanceId`** — `GameObject.GetInstanceID()` for unique identification of duplicate-named objects in hierarchy snapshots.
- **`HierarchyNode.depth`** — Camera distance for front-to-back rendering order (lower = closer). 3D objects use camera Z-distance; UI elements use negative canvas sort order + hierarchy order.
- **`HierarchyNode.worldBounds`** — Raw world-space AABB `[cx, cy, cz, ex, ey, ez]` for 3D objects with visible Renderers. Projected to screen-space client-side.
- **`HierarchySnapshot.cameraMatrix`** — 4x4 view-projection matrix (row-major) for client-side 3D→screen coordinate projection.
- **Unfocused play mode** — `Application.runInBackground = true` is set automatically before tests start (`RunStarted`) and restored after tests finish (`RunFinished`), ensuring tests continue running when the Unity editor loses focus.

### Changed
- **3D bounds use client-side projection** — Hierarchy snapshots store raw world-space AABBs and the camera VP matrix instead of projecting per-object with `WorldToScreenPoint`. Eliminates expensive per-object native interop calls in `BuildHierarchy`.
- **`GetHierarchyOrder()` simplified** — Uses `depth * 1000 + siblingIndex` (zero-allocation) instead of root-to-leaf walk with `Transform[]` allocation per call.
- **Test run creation deferred** — `RunBatchCallbacks` creates server runs on the first actual test method (`TestStarted`) instead of `RunStarted`, preventing empty "0 tests" runs from Test Runner scans and recompilations.
- **Upload timeout unlimited** — `HttpClient.Timeout` set to `InfiniteTimeSpan` for diagnostic zip uploads, preventing timeouts on large video recordings over slow connections.

## [1.2.9] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **`TestReport` diagnostic system** — Automatic test session capture with video recording, screenshots, hierarchy snapshots, and structured console logs. Sessions are packaged as `.zip` archives in `temporaryCachePath/UIAutomation_Diagnostics/`.
- **Cross-platform video recorder (`MediaRecorder`)** — Integrated under `Recorder/` and `Plugins/`. Supports Windows (Media Foundation), Android (MediaCodec), iOS/macOS (AVAssetWriter). Editor uses Unity Recorder backend at 1280x720, 15 FPS.
- **Server integration** — Auto-upload diagnostic sessions to a centralized ASP.NET Core server. Configurable via **Edit > Project Settings > UI Automation** (server URL, API key, auto-upload toggle, upload passes toggle).
- **Test run lifecycle** — `RunBatchCallbacks` hooks Unity Test Runner to create/finish test runs on the server. Sessions are grouped by run.
- **Upload queue** — `AutoUploadHook` queues uploads on thread pool instead of blocking per-test. `DrainUploadQueue()` waits for all uploads before the test batch exits.
- **`ActionExecutor.Snapshot()`** — Captures detailed hierarchy snapshot with full component properties (text, colors, sizes, interactable states, layout settings).
- **Console log capture** — `Application.logMessageReceived` hooked during sessions. All Unity console output stored as `LogEntry` with extended logTypes: Screenshot (5), Snapshot (6), ActionStart (7), ActionSuccess (8), ActionWarn (9), ActionFailure (10).
- **Code location tracking** — `DiagEvent` captures `callerFile`, `callerLine`, `callerMethod` via stack walking to identify test source code.
- **Hierarchy snapshots capture all GameObjects** — Uses `FindObjectsByType<Transform>` for full scene capture. 3D objects get annotations for Camera, Light, MeshRenderer, Collider, Rigidbody, Animator, AudioSource, ParticleSystem.
- **Persistent data capture** — On test failure, `Application.persistentDataPath` contents are optionally included in diagnostic zips (max 50 MB, 3 levels deep). Toggle via Project Settings.
- **Custom metadata** — `TestReport.MetadataCallback` for project-specific metadata. `TestReport.AutoDetectVCS` for Git/Plastic SCM auto-detection.
- **`com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` dependency** — For hierarchy JSON serialization (no depth limit).

### Changed
- **`FailureDiagnostics` renamed to `TestReport`** — Better reflects that it captures all test results, not just failures.
- **`UIAutomationTestFixture.TearDown()` is now `async Task`** — Awaits session end and upload before next test starts.
- **`UIAutomationTestFixture.SetUp()` creates fallback camera** — Auto-creates depth -100 camera when none exists, ensuring recordings/screenshots always have a depth buffer.
- **Hierarchy snapshots use nested `roots`/`children` format** — Serialized with Newtonsoft.Json instead of JsonUtility (no 10-level depth cap).
- **`InputInjector` saves/restores individual settings** — Saves `backgroundBehavior` and `editorInputBehaviorInPlayMode` individually instead of cloning the entire `InputSettings` ScriptableObject.
- **`InputVisualizer` icons have transparent backgrounds** — Cursor icons (mouse, click, touch, scroll) converted from black to transparent backgrounds.
- **`InputVisualizer` scales by screen resolution** — All sizes scale by `Screen.height / 1080f`. Base cursor size reduced from 48px to 32px at 1080p.
- **`BuildFailureReport` returns short assertion message** — Full report in `FAILURE_REPORT.txt`, not the exception message.
- **Diagnostic zips use `CompressionLevel.NoCompression`** — Faster packaging.
- **Screenshots captured via `WaitForEndOfFrame` coroutine** — Replaces mid-frame `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshotAsTexture()` that caused gray/empty captures.

### Fixed
- **`InputInjector.OnPlayModeStateChanged`** — No longer touches InputSystem APIs during `ExitingPlayMode`, preventing native assertion spam.
- **`InputInjector.TearDown()`** — Device cleanup wrapped in try/catch to prevent assertion crashes.
- **`Near()` and `Adjacent()` spatial filters** — Now use `UIUtility.GetScreenBounds()` for proper screen-space coordinates on all canvas types.
- **`FindBestAdjacentElement()`** — Iterates `Selectable` components directly instead of walking `RectTransform` hierarchies.
- **`Near()` direction filter** — Changed from strict edge-based to center-based check, matching `Adjacent()` behavior.
- **Native crash in complex scenes** — `Search.Find()`/`FindAll()` now do `await Task.Delay(1)` before first `FindObjectsByType` call to break out of the `ExecuteTasks` pipeline.
- **Screenshots missing from zips** — PNG writes now tracked in `_pendingFileWrites` and awaited before zipping.
- **Action events logged twice** — Removed duplicate `Log()` calls from `ActionExecutor`; `TestReport.LogAction` handles all console output.
- **Video recording stall** — `EditorRecorderBackend` uses `FrameRatePlayback.Variable` to avoid Media Foundation rate control backpressure.
- **Audio capture always enabled** — Uses `MovieRecorderSettings.CaptureAudio` property setter instead of `AudioInputSettings.PreserveAudio`.
- **Double `.mp4.mp4` extension** — `OutputPath` now passes filename without extension.
- **Video playback stopping early** — `GetDuration()` prefers actual `VideoPlayer.length` over session metadata.
- **Encoder odd resolution crash** — Resolution rounded to even values with `& ~1`.

### Removed
- **`DiagnosticsViewerWindow`** — Built-in Unity EditorWindow viewer replaced by web-based viewer.
- **`ClearScreen()` from `SetUp()`** — `Camera.Render()` during SetUp could corrupt native state.

### Breaking
- **`com.unity.recorder` is now a required dependency** (was previously optional).

## [1.2.8] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **`Search.Texture()` dynamic shader property discovery** — Material texture matching now dynamically enumerates all texture properties declared by the shader via `Shader.GetPropertyCount()`/`GetPropertyType()`, replacing the previous hardcoded list of 16 property names. Works with any render pipeline (Standard, URP, HDRP) and custom shaders without maintenance.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Player build IL2CPP linker errors** — All source files in the main assembly are now wrapped in `#if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`, so the entire API only compiles in editor and test player builds. Regular player builds no longer fail from NUnit references.
- **`ThrowTestFailure` exception type mismatch** — Now throws `NUnit.Framework.AssertionException` instead of `UnityEngine.Assertions.AssertionException`. Test `catch (AssertionException)` blocks (which resolve to the NUnit type via `using NUnit.Framework`) now correctly catch action failures.
- **`AllPublicAsyncMethods_UseRunAction` test source file not found** — Uses `[CallerFilePath]` to locate `ActionExecutor.cs` instead of `Application.dataPath`, which returns temp paths when the package is imported via `file:` reference.

### Added
- **`link.xml`** — Preserves `nunit.framework` from IL2CPP managed code stripping in test player builds.
- **`com.unity.ext.nunit` package dependency** — Provides AOT-compatible `nunit.framework.dll` for player builds.

### Changed
- **asmdef uses explicit NUnit reference** — `overrideReferences: true` with `precompiledReferences: ["nunit.framework.dll"]` ensures the NUnit DLL is included in test player builds.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Mouse position teleport causes camera jumps** — Replaced `DeltaStateEvent` with full `StateEvent` in `InjectPointerTap`, `InjectPointerDoubleTap`, `InjectPointerTripleTap`, `InjectPointerHold`, and `InjectScroll`. Every mouse event now explicitly sets position, delta=zero, and button state, preventing stale state from triggering game camera controllers between actions.
- **Visualizer icon pivot offsets** — `DrawIcon` now uses per-icon hotspot offsets. Mouse-click starburst centers on click point, touch finger aligns fingertip to position, scroll icons center on scroll point.
- **Consecutive drags bleed into each other** — Increased settle time to 4 frames after button release (was 2) and 2 frames before drag start (was 1).

### Added
- **`ClampToScreen()` helper** — Keeps all injected screen positions at least 1px inside screen edges. Applied to all drag, pinch, rotate, and two-finger gesture methods.

### Changed
- **Removed all manual `InputSystem.Update()` calls** — Events are now queued and processed by Unity's natural update cycle, ensuring all scripts (including those checking `wasPressedThisFrame`/`wasReleasedThisFrame`) see each state change correctly.
- **Realistic input timing** — `InjectPointerTap` spreads press/release over ~8 frames (~133ms at 60fps). `InjectTouchTap` spans ~6 frames. All keyboard, gesture, and drag methods use similar realistic spacing.
- **Minimum drag frames increased** — Drag interpolation uses 10 minimum frames (was 5), ~167ms at 60fps for more realistic drag speed.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Hardware input not restored after test crash** — Added `EditorApplication.playModeStateChanged` hook to restore hardware devices, remove virtual devices, and reset input settings when exiting play mode. Prevents keyboard/mouse from staying disabled if TearDown didn't run.
- **Domain reload leaves hardware devices disabled** — `OnDomainReload` now re-enables all disabled hardware devices (previously only cleaned up virtual devices and cleared stale references).

## [1.2.4] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Player build failure: IL2CPP linker cannot resolve `nunit.framework`** — Removed `#if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` guards and `overrideReferences`/`precompiledReferences` from the asmdef. NUnit is now provided unconditionally via auto-reference, requiring a Custom NUnit package (or equivalent) that ships `nunit.framework.dll` in player builds.

### Changed
- **`UIAutomationTestFixture` no longer conditional** — The test fixture class is always compiled, removing the `#if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` wrapper.
- **`ThrowTestFailure` always throws `AssertionException`** — No longer falls back to `InvalidOperationException` in non-test builds.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **`Search.InvokeAsync()` and `Search.InvokeAsync<T>()`** — Await async methods invoked via Reflect paths. `await Search.Reflect("ParseAccountAPI").InvokeAsync("LogoutAsync")` calls the method and awaits the returned Task. `InvokeAsync<T>` returns the typed result from `Task<T>`.

### Changed
- **`Search.Invoke()` now supports static methods** — When `Reflect()` resolves to a type name (e.g., `Search.Reflect("PlayerPrefs")`), `Invoke` uses `BindingFlags.Static` to call static methods directly without an instance.
- **`Search.Invoke()` smart method resolution** — Method matching now handles optional/default parameters (omitted args filled with defaults), implicit numeric conversions (int→long, float→double, etc.), and type-compatible arguments. Exact type matches are preferred over widening conversions.
- **`Search.Invoke()` error messages list available signatures** — When no matching method is found, the error message now includes all available overloads with parameter types and names, making it easier to diagnose mismatched arguments.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Player build failure: "UnityEditor.dll assembly is referenced by user code"** — Root cause was `UnityEngine.TestRunner` in the main assembly's asmdef references, which chains to `UnityEditor.CoreModule`. Removed the reference entirely; NUnit is now provided via `precompiledReferences: ["nunit.framework.dll"]`.

### Changed
- **`editorInputBehaviorInPlayMode` no longer wrapped in `#if UNITY_EDITOR`** — This setting is in the `UnityEngine.InputSystem` namespace (runtime assembly), not `UnityEditor`. Removed the unnecessary guard.

### Removed
- **`IgnoreErrorLogs` virtual property** — Removed from `UIAutomationTestFixture`. This property set `LogAssert.ignoreFailingMessages` which required `UnityEngine.TestRunner`. If needed, set `UnityEngine.TestTools.LogAssert.ignoreFailingMessages = true` directly in your test's `SetUp()`.
- **`EditorApplication.playModeStateChanged` safety hook** — Removed from `InputInjector`. The `Application.quitting` callback and `InputSystem.settings` restore in `TearDown()` provide sufficient cleanup.
- **All `#if UNITY_EDITOR` / `using UnityEditor` from `InputInjector`** — No editor code remains in the runtime assembly.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **`UIUtility` public static class** — Single source of truth for screen-space utility methods: `GetScreenPosition(GameObject)`, `GetScreenPosition(Component)`, `GetScreenBounds()`, `GetHitsAtPosition()`, `GetReceiversAtPosition()`. Use this instead of `InputInjector` (which is now internal).

### Changed
- **`InputInjector` screen utilities delegate to `UIUtility`** — `GetScreenPosition`, `GetScreenBounds`, `GetHitsAtPosition`, `GetReceiversAtPosition` are still available on `InputInjector` internally but now delegate to `UIUtility`.
- **`Search` screen utilities delegate to `UIUtility`** — `GetScreenCenter`, `GetScreenBounds`, and private `GetScreenPosition` eliminated duplicate implementations.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Breaking Changes
- **`UITestBase` renamed to `UIAutomationTestFixture`** — Class renamed and moved from `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Testing` namespace to `ODDGames.UIAutomation`. Update: `using ODDGames.UIAutomation;` and change class name in test declarations.
- **`ODDGames.UIAutomation.Testing` assembly removed** — Test fixture now lives in the main `ODDGames.UIAutomation` assembly. Remove `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Testing` from asmdef references.
- **`InputInjector` is now `internal`** — No longer accessible from external assemblies. Use `UIAutomationTestFixture` base class instead, which handles input setup/teardown automatically.
- **`InputInjector.DisableHardwareInput()` / `EnableHardwareInput()` removed** — Replaced by `InputInjector.Setup()` / `TearDown()` lifecycle (called automatically by `UIAutomationTestFixture`).

### Changed
- **`InputInjector` follows `InputTestFixture` pattern** — Explicit `Setup()`/`TearDown()` lifecycle instead of eager initialization on domain reload. `OnDomainReload()` now only cleans up orphaned devices.
- **`InputInjector.Setup()` saves and restores `InputSystem.settings`** — Settings are snapshotted before modification and restored in `TearDown()`, preventing permanent clobbering of game settings like `backgroundBehavior`.
- **`UIAutomationTestFixture` handles full input lifecycle** — `SetUp()` calls `InputInjector.Setup()` (virtual devices, hardware isolation, settings). `TearDown()` calls `InputInjector.TearDown()` (restore everything).
- **All test classes extend `UIAutomationTestFixture`** — Standardized input setup across all tests, removing duplicate manual mouse reset and EventSystem cleanup boilerplate.
- **Consolidated to two assemblies** — `ODDGames.UIAutomation` (runtime) and `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Editor` (editor). Removed AI, Recording, VisualBuilder, and Testing assemblies.

### Removed
- **AI Testing module** — Entire `AI/` directory (actions, models, navigation, screen analysis, strategy, debug, editor panels)
- **Recording module** — `Recording/` directory (input interceptor, recorder, generator, settings)
- **Visual Builder module** — `VisualBuilder/` directory (element selector, visual blocks, runtime compiler, editor panels)
- **Auto Explorer** — `AutoExplorer.cs`
- **Editor hooks** — `InputInjectorEditorHooks.cs`, `UITestLiveRecorder.cs`

## [1.1.43] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **`InjectScroll()` uses `DeltaStateEvent` for correct scroll injection** — Full-state `QueueStateEvent` with `MouseState` was clobbering delta controls that reset each frame. Now uses `DeltaStateEvent.From(mouse.scroll)` matching Unity's `InputTestFixture.Set()` pattern. Scroll event no longer calls `InputSystem.Update()` manually, letting the player loop process it so the scroll delta isn't reset before `InputSystemUIInputModule.Process()` reads it.
- **`ScaleToGameViewWindow()` removed from all input injection** — Was transforming coordinates to Game View render-target space but Input System expects `Screen.width/height` space, causing clicks, scrolls, and gestures to miss their targets.
- **Search ordering preserved** — `Near()`, `OrderBy()`, `OrderByPosition()` etc. were being overwritten by a depth-sort applied unconditionally after post-processing. Depth-sort now only applies as fallback when no custom ordering is set.
- **`EnsureGameViewFocusAsync()` on all injection entry points** — `InjectPointerTap`, `Swipe`, `TypeText`, `InjectPinch`, `InjectTwoFingerDrag`, `InjectRotatePixels` now ensure Game View focus before injecting events.
- **`LogAssert.Expect` added to tests** catching expected `AssertionException` from `ActionScope.Fail()`.

### Changed
- **Input injection uses `DeltaStateEvent` consistently** — Mouse click, hold, and scroll methods now use `DeltaStateEvent.From(control)` for individual controls instead of full `MouseState` structs, matching Unity's `InputTestFixture` pattern and avoiding delta control clobbering.
- **Touch tap simplified to `TouchState` struct** — `InjectTouchTap` now uses `InputSystem.QueueStateEvent(touchscreen, new TouchState{...})` (one line per event) instead of 6-line `WriteValueIntoEvent` calls, matching Unity's `InputTestFixture.SetTouch()` pattern.
- **Click speed dramatically improved** — Press+release now happen in consecutive frames instead of being spread across ~160ms of delays. Single click: ~3 frames (was ~7 frames + 160ms). Double/triple click use compact loop patterns.
- **All internal delays reduced to frame-based waits** — pointerEnter gap reduced from 2 frames + 50ms to 1 frame. Key press/release, modifier combos, and touch taps all use `DelayFrames(1)` instead of `Async.Delay(frames, seconds)`.
- **`ActionExecutor.Interval` default reduced from 200ms to 50ms** — 4x faster waits between high-level test actions.
- **Default drag/swipe/gesture duration halved from 0.3s to 0.15s** — All drag, swipe, pinch, rotate, and two-finger gesture defaults are now twice as fast.
- **Inter-click gap reduced to 50ms** — Double/triple click inter-click delay reduced from 120ms to 50ms (still within multi-click speed threshold).
- **`EnsureGameViewFocusAsync()` caches Game View reference** — Avoids reflection lookup on every call (runs in every delay loop iteration).
- **Virtual input devices created eagerly in `OnDomainReload`** — All hardware devices disabled at init so `<Mouse>/position` etc. can only resolve to virtual devices, eliminating `.current` race conditions.
- **`editorInputBehaviorInPlayMode = AllDeviceInputAlwaysGoesToGameView`** — Routes all virtual device input to Game View during play mode (matches Unity's `InputTestFixture`).
- **Test search timeouts reduced to 0.5s** — All test `searchTime`, `timeout`, and `seconds` parameters reduced from 2s to 0.5s (or 1s for delayed-element tests) to prevent slow hangs on expected failures.

### Added
- **Percentage parameter validation (0-1 range)** on all public API methods — `ClickAt`, `SwipeAt`, `PinchAt`, `RotateAt`, `TwoFingerSwipeAt`, `ClickSlider`, `DragSlider`, `SetSlider`, `SetScrollbar`, `Scroll(direction)`, `Search.InRegion`; throws `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` for values outside 0-1.
- **Full gesture visualization** in InputVisualizer (pinch, rotate, two-finger drag, key presses, text input).
- **3D object click tests** (with and without collider) in InputInjectorTests.

## [1.1.42] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **`InjectScroll()` now actually scrolls** - Added `ScaleToGameViewWindow()` for correct mouse positioning in the Editor (matching `InjectPointerTap`), and wait frames after moving mouse so the EventSystem establishes `pointerEnter` before sending scroll events. Previously scroll events were silently dropped because the mouse was at wrong coordinates and `ProcessPointerScroll()` requires `pointerEnter` to be set.
- **`LoadTestData()` now clears PlayerPrefs** - Clear all PlayerPrefs before restoring test data, while preserving Unity-internal keys (Addressables, Unity Services, IAP). Previously leftover PlayerPrefs from prior test runs would persist and pollute test state.

## [1.1.41] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Player build failures from test-only assemblies** - Removed `versionDefines` that self-defined `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` from all 6 asmdefs. The define was always active (test-framework is always installed in editor), causing NUnit/LogAssert/TestRunner code to compile in player builds where those assemblies don't exist.

### Changed
- **Testing assembly is now editor-only** - Added `includePlatforms: ["Editor"]` to `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Testing.asmdef` since it depends on `UnityEngine.TestRunner` and `nunit.framework.dll` which are editor-only.
- **AITestDiscovery guard changed to `#if UNITY_EDITOR`** - The entire file uses NUnit and AssetDatabase, so `UNITY_EDITOR` is the correct guard (not `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`).
- **VisualTestRunner no longer depends on NUnit directly** - Uses `Assert.Fail()` via `#if UNITY_EDITOR` for PlayMode test integration, falls back to `InvalidOperationException` in player builds. This allows VisualTestRunner to work on-device.
- **Removed `defineConstraints: ["UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS"]`** from Editor, VisualBuilder, VisualBuilder.Editor, and AI.Editor asmdefs. Editor asmdefs are already protected by `includePlatforms: ["Editor"]`. VisualBuilder runtime assembly needs to compile in player builds.

## [1.1.40] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **`LogAssert` guard changed from `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` to `UNITY_EDITOR`** - `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` is defined via `versionDefines` even in player builds (when test-framework package is installed), but `LogAssert` lives in `UnityEngine.TestRunner` which is editor-only. Using `#if UNITY_EDITOR` correctly excludes the call from player builds.

## [1.1.39] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Testing assembly compiles in player builds** - Wrapped `LogAssert.ignoreFailingMessages` in `#if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` guard so `UITestBase` compiles when test-framework is unavailable (e.g. production builds)
- **Testing assembly uses `versionDefines` without `defineConstraints`** - Self-defines `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` when test-framework is present, but always compiles regardless

## [1.1.38] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Testing assembly no longer uses `defineConstraints`** - Removed `defineConstraints: ["UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS"]` and set `autoReferenced: false` to prevent the Testing assembly from being skipped by Unity's constraint evaluation. Consumer assemblies reference it explicitly by name instead.

## [1.1.37] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Testing assembly now self-defines `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`** - Added `versionDefines` to detect `com.unity.test-framework` and satisfy its own `defineConstraints`, fixing `UITestBase` not found errors

## [1.1.36] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Removed `LogAssert` dependency from core assembly** - Replaced `LogAssert.ignoreFailingMessages` in AITestRunner/AITestDiscovery with existing custom log handler, eliminating the need for `UnityEngine.TestRunner` reference in the core assembly
- **Testing assembly now references `UnityEngine.TestRunner`** - Ensures `LogAssert` works properly in UITestBase

## [1.1.35] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Removed deprecated `optionalUnityReferences` from all assemblies** - This Unity 6 deprecated field was silently preventing the core assembly from compiling in some projects, causing `ODDGames` namespace not found errors in downstream test assemblies

## [1.1.34] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Testing assembly now supports PlayMode tests** - Removed `includePlatforms: ["Editor"]` restriction
  - Testing assembly can now be referenced by PlayMode test assemblies
  - Uses `defineConstraints: ["UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS"]` to ensure exclusion from player builds
  - Fixes "ODDGames namespace not found" errors when referencing UITestBase from PlayMode tests

## [1.1.30] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Testing assembly now Editor-only** - Added `includePlatforms: ["Editor"]` to Testing assembly
  - Prevents LogAssert/NUnit errors when Test Framework not fully configured in consuming projects
  - Testing assembly only compiles in Editor context where Test Framework is guaranteed

## [1.1.29] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **`AITestRunner` and `AITestDiscovery` moved to Testing assembly** - These files now in `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Testing`
  - Fixes build errors when Test Framework not installed (LogAssert/NUnit references)
  - Core runtime assembly (`ODDGames.UIAutomation`) now has zero test dependencies
  - Works correctly in player builds without Test Framework

## [1.1.28] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `UITestBase` moved to separate assembly** - Now in `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Testing`
  - User test assemblies must add reference to `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Testing`
  - Testing assembly only compiles when Test Framework is installed (via `defineConstraints`)
  - Core runtime (`ODDGames.UIAutomation`) no longer has any test dependencies
  - `CaptureUnobservedExceptions` moved to always-available in core assembly (no longer conditional)

## [1.1.27] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Assembly definitions now auto-define `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`** - Added `versionDefines` to detect Test Framework
  - All assemblies with `defineConstraints: ["UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS"]` now have matching `versionDefines`
  - Fixes "namespace 'ODDGames' could not be found" errors when Test Framework is installed but define was missing
  - Unity's `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` is not globally defined - must be set per-assembly via `versionDefines`

## [1.1.26] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **All test-related assemblies excluded from builds without Test Framework** - Added `defineConstraints: ["UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS"]` to:
  - `ODDGames.UIAutomation.Editor` (main editor assembly)
  - `ODDGames.UIAutomation.VisualBuilder` (visual test builder)
  - `ODDGames.UIAutomation.VisualBuilder.Editor` (visual builder editor)
  - `ODDGames.UIAutomation.AI.Editor` (AI test editor)
  - Previously these assemblies would fail to compile when Test Framework was not installed
  - Core runtime assembly (`ODDGames.UIAutomation`) still compiles without tests for runtime-only usage

## [1.1.25] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **UITestBase now compiles in builds without Test Framework** - Wrapped entire class in `#if UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`
  - Previously `UITestBase.cs` would cause build errors when Test Framework package was not installed
  - Assembly definition now uses `optionalUnityReferences: ["TestAssemblies"]` for conditional test support

## [1.1.24] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **`InputVisualizer` cursor fade-out** - Cursor icon now gradually fades over 1.5 seconds after actions complete
  - Configurable via `InputVisualizer.CursorFadeDuration`
  - Previously cursor disappeared instantly

### Changed
- **Realistic input injection timing** - All input methods now simulate realistic user interaction speeds
  - Single click: ~160ms total (80ms button down, 30ms release)
  - Double/Triple click: ~120ms between clicks (was 50ms)
  - Touch tap: ~110ms total (80ms contact, 30ms release)
  - Key press: ~110ms total (80ms down, 30ms release)
  - Scroll: ~160ms total (80ms move to position, 50ms scroll, 30ms reset)
  - Previously timings were 20-50ms which was too fast for realistic simulation

### Fixed
- **`InjectScroll` no longer triggers clicks** - Scroll methods now use explicit `MouseState` struct
  - Previously `StateEvent.From(mouse)` could inherit button state from prior operations
  - Now explicitly sets all button states to released during scroll

## [1.1.23] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Failure messages now logged before throwing** - `ActionScope.Fail()` logs error message before throwing `AssertionException`
  - Failure reason is now visible in Unity console: `[UIAutomation] FAILED: Click(Text("Button")) failed: Element not found within 10s`
  - Previously the failure message was only in the exception, which could be truncated in test results

## [1.1.22] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **All failures now throw `NUnit.Framework.AssertionException`** - Simplified exception handling
  - Removed `UIAutomationException`, `UIAutomationTimeoutException`, `UIAutomationNotFoundException` custom exception classes
  - All action failures (element not found, timeouts, invalid paths) now throw `AssertionException` directly
  - Ensures proper test failure reporting in Unity Test Runner without exception swallowing

## [1.1.21] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **`ActionScope.Fail()` now uses NUnit `Assert.Fail()`** when `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` is defined
  - Previously only threw `UIAutomationTimeoutException` which could be swallowed by async continuations
  - Now properly reports test failures in Unity Test Runner with correct stack traces
  - Non-test contexts still throw `UIAutomationTimeoutException`

## [1.1.20] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **`InputVisualizer` PNG icon support** - Visual feedback now uses PNG icons loaded from Resources folder
  - Icons: mouse-cursor, mouse-click, touch, touch-tap, scroll-up, scroll-down
  - White icons with black shadows for contrast on any background
- **`Async.Delay(int minFrames, float minSeconds)`** - Wait for both minimum frames AND minimum time
  - Used for timing-critical operations where both frame processing and real-time thresholds matter

### Changed
- **`InputVisualizer` uses OnGUI rendering** - Works without cameras, regardless of render pipeline
  - Previously used GL rendering which required a camera
  - Now renders cursor icons, click ripples, and trails via Unity's immediate mode GUI
- **Improved input injection timing reliability** - All tap/click methods now use `Async.Delay(frames, seconds)`
  - `InjectPointerTap` uses 2 frames + 20ms per step
  - `InjectPointerDoubleTap`/`TripleTap` use 2 frames + 20ms per step, 4 frames + 50ms between clicks
  - `InjectTouchTap` uses 2 frames + 20ms for began/ended phases
  - `InjectTouchDoubleTap`/`TripleTap` use 4 frames + 50ms between taps
  - Fixes sporadic test failures from insufficient timing between input events

### Added
- **`InputInjector.GetHitsAtPosition(Vector2)`** - Gets all raycast hits at a screen position using EventSystem.RaycastAll
- **`InputInjector.GetReceiversAtPosition(Vector2, params Type[])`** - Gets GameObjects with specified handler interfaces (IPointerClickHandler, IDragHandler, etc.) at a screen position
- **`Search.RequiresReceiver(params Type[])`** - Filter to elements where receivers with specified handler types exist at the element's screen position
- **`Search.Receivers` property** - Returns the receivers found by the last RequiresReceiver evaluation

### Changed
- **Receiver logging on action completion** - Click, DoubleClick, TripleClick, Hold, Drag, DragTo, Scroll, Type methods now log receiver hierarchy paths when actions complete, showing what GameObjects at the target position have event handler interfaces
- **Optional receiver logging for "At" methods** - ClickAt, DoubleClickAt, TripleClickAt, HoldAt, DragFromTo, Drag(Vector2) methods now have optional `requireReceivers` parameter (default false) to enable receiver logging

## [1.1.18] - 2026-02-05

### Removed
- **`EnsureSceneLoaded()`** from ActionExecutor - use `LoadScene()` (UITestBase) instead
- **`RestoreGameState()`** from UITestBase - use `LoadTestData()` (ActionExecutor) directly
- **`LogPersistentDataState()`** and `FormatFileSize()` private helpers from UITestBase (unused after RestoreGameState removal)

## [1.1.17] - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- **Case-insensitive `Name()` and `Text()` matching** - Both methods now default to `ignoreCase: true`
  - `Name("MainMenu")` matches "mainmenu", "MAINMENU", etc.
  - `Text("Play")` matches "play", "PLAY", etc.
  - Opt out with `ignoreCase: false` for exact-case matching
- **Stability-checked `Search.Find()` and `Search.FindAll()`** - Results must be consistent for 3 consecutive frames before returning
  - Replaces the old synchronous `FindFirst()`/`FindAll()` + separate `Resolve()` pattern
  - Results are ordered: on-screen UI elements first, then on-screen non-UI, then off-screen
  - Logs matched elements with positions on first match for debugging
- **Simplified `ActionExecutor` internal search** - Removed `ResolveSearch()`, `ResolveSearchAll()`, `ResolveDropdown()`, `ResolveDropdownByLabel()`, `ResolveSearch<T>()` recovery-polling methods
  - All search logic now delegates to `Search.Find()`/`Search.FindAll()` with built-in stability checking
  - `Click()`, `Find<T>()`, `FindAll<T>()` are simpler and more reliable
- **`ActionScope.Fail()` uses NUnit `Assert.Fail()`** instead of throwing `UIAutomationTimeoutException` when `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS` is defined
  - Provides proper test failure reporting in Unity Test Runner
- **`Exists()` is now async** - `Search.Exists(float timeout)` returns `Task<bool>` with timeout support
- **`Value` property restricted to Reflect paths** - For UI element searches, use `await search.Find()` instead
- **Removed typed value properties from UI element searches** - `StringValue`, `BoolValue`, `FloatValue`, `IntValue`, `Vector3Value`, `Vector2Value`, `ColorValue`, `QuaternionValue` on UI searches removed; use `GetValue<T>()` with `await Find()` instead (Reflect paths still support `GetValue<T>()`)
- **`EnsureSceneLoaded()` waits for stable frame rate** - New `minFps` parameter (default 20 FPS) ensures scene is ready before continuing
- **`LoadScene()` waits for stable frame rate** - New `minFps` parameter (default 20 FPS) on `UITestBase.LoadScene()`

- **`UITestBase.IgnoreErrorLogs`** - Virtual property (default: `true`) to ignore error/exception logs during tests via `LogAssert.ignoreFailingMessages`
- **Play mode exit safety** - `InputInjector` re-enables hardware input devices when exiting play mode if they were disabled during testing
- **URP/HDRP `InputVisualizer` support** - Visualization now renders on both built-in and scriptable render pipelines via `RenderPipelineManager.endCameraRendering`
- **`InputVisualizer` early-exit optimization** - Skips rendering when no events to draw
- **Test Runner compact mode** - Toolbar buttons adapt to narrow window widths (< 450px)

### Fixed
- **Input click reliability** - `InjectPointerTap` and `InjectTouchTap` now hold each state for 2 frames instead of 1, improving click registration on complex UIs
- **Camera fallback for world-space canvas** - `GetScreenPosition()` properly falls back to `Camera.main` when `canvas.worldCamera` is null
- **Detected recovery flow** - `RunDetectedFlows()` now uses async `Exists(0.5f)` instead of synchronous check

## [1.1.16] - 2026-02-02

### Changed
- **TimeScale-independent waits** - All timeout and polling operations now use `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch` instead of Unity's `Time.realtimeSinceStartup`
  - Enables running tests at higher game speeds (e.g., `Time.timeScale = 3`) while keeping real-time waits
  - `ActionExecutor` wait loops use new `Now` property based on `Stopwatch.GetTimestamp()`
  - `Search.Resolve()` timeout checks use `Stopwatch` for consistent behavior
- **Virtual device naming** - Virtual input devices now use `UIAutomation_` prefix for easier identification

## [1.1.15] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **`InputVisualizer`** - GL-based input visualization overlay that works over entire screen
  - Shows clicks, drags, scrolls, and key presses with visual feedback

  - `InjectPointerDoubleTap` uses `DelayFrames(3)` between clicks
  - `InjectTouchDoubleTap` uses `DelayFrames(3)` between taps
  - `InjectPointerTripleTap` uses `DelayFrames(2)` between clicks
  - `InjectTouchTripleTap` uses `DelayFrames(2)` between taps
- **Drag operation timing stability** - Added initial frame delay before starting drags to ensure previous input state settles

## [1.1.13] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **No-code AI tests via ScriptableObjects** - Create AI tests as assets that automatically appear in Unity's Test Runner
  - Create via `+ AI Test` button in Test Runner toolbar or `Create > UITest > AI Test`
  - Tests appear under `AI > TestName` in the Test Runner
  - Each `AITest` asset is a ScriptableObject with prompt, knowledge, and configuration

- **`AINavigator`** - Multi-turn conversation recovery for stuck AI tests
  - Automatically engages when AI reports being stuck or taking no action
  - Uses focused recovery prompts to help AI find alternative approaches
  - Configurable max recovery attempts (default: 3)

### Removed
- **`AIPromptTest`** - Script-based test class removed in favor of ScriptableObject-only approach
  - All AI tests should now be created as `AITest` assets
  - Simplifies test creation to pure no-code workflow

### Changed
- **AI test class structure** - Renamed from `AITestDiscovery` to `AI` for cleaner Test Runner display
  - Tests now appear as `AI > TestName` instead of `AITestDiscovery > RunAITest(TestName)`

## [1.1.12] - 2026-01-28

### Removed
- `IgnoreErrors` property - use `LogAssert.ignoreFailingMessages` directly instead (Unity's API doesn't work outside test context)

## [1.1.11] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- `CaptureUnobservedExceptions` property - set to `true` to capture fire-and-forget Task exceptions
- `CapturedExceptions` read-only list and `ClearCapturedExceptions()` method for inspecting captured exceptions
- Test runner assembly reference for test-only features (guarded by `UNITY_INCLUDE_TESTS`)

### Removed
- `UITestAttribute` - unused metadata attribute removed

## [1.1.10] - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `ClickAt(float, float)` and `ClickAt(Vector2)` now interpret values as percentages (0-1) instead of pixel coordinates
  - `ClickAt(0.5f, 0.5f)` clicks at screen center (50%, 50%)
  - Consistent with `PinchAt`, `SwipeAt`, and other percentage-based methods
- All public async methods in `ActionExecutor` now use unified `RunAction` pattern for consistent START/COMPLETE logging
- `ActionScope` refactored to support async awaiter pattern: `await using var action = await RunAction(...)`
- `ActionScope` now ensures main thread before logging START (via `Async.ToMainThread()`)

### Fixed
- Focus stealing during multi-click operations now handled properly
  - `InjectPointerDoubleTap` ensures Game View focus before second click
  - `InjectPointerTripleTap` ensures Game View focus before each click
  - Prevents flaky tests when user steals focus during test execution

## [1.1.9] - 2026-01-28

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed implicit string to Search conversion - `Click("text")` no longer compiles
  - Use explicit search methods: `Click(Text("text"))` or `Click(Name("name"))`
  - This prevents confusion where `"ToggleDebug"` would search for text content, not GameObject name

## [1.1.8] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- `UIAutomationException`, `UIAutomationTimeoutException`, `UIAutomationNotFoundException` exception classes for better error identification
- `LogStart()`, `LogComplete()`, `LogFail()` helper methods for consistent action logging

- All exceptions now use `UIAutomationException` family instead of generic `TimeoutException`/`InvalidOperationException`
- Default `holdTime` reduced from 0.5s to 0.05s for all drag operations - most drags don't need a long hold before movement
- Default gesture `duration` reduced from 1.0s to 0.3s (Drag, Swipe, Pinch, Rotate, TwoFingerSwipe)
- `ScrollTo` searchTime default increased from 5s to 10f for consistency
- `ClickDropdown` maxWaitTime for options increased from 0.5s to 2s for slow UI
- `InjectMouseDrag` and `InjectTouchDrag` now `internal` - use `InjectPointerDrag` instead
- Removed unused `UITEST_AI` version define from Editor asmdef

### Fixed
- `SwipeAt` now passes `holdTime: 0f` - swipes are immediate drag motions without hold delay
- Swipe/SwipeAt nested logging - internal method now used to prevent double START/COMPLETE logs
- `InjectMouseDrag`/`InjectTouchDrag` timing reliability:
  - Now uses minimum 5 frames for drag motion regardless of timing
  - Yields one frame when `holdTime=0` to ensure initial position registers
  - Yields after final position event before releasing button/touch to ensure delta is processed
  - Fixes flaky swipe tests that failed when timing raced ahead of frame processing
- `SwipeAtInternal` now uses `InjectPointerDrag` (ensures Game View focus)
- Added `EnsureGameViewFocusAsync` to `InjectTwoFingerSwipe`, `InjectPinch`, `InjectTwoFingerDrag`, `InjectRotate`

## [1.1.7] - 2026-01-28

  - All methods now in single `ActionExecutor` class
- **BREAKING**: `UITestBehaviour` base class completely removed - use standard NUnit `[TestFixture]` pattern
- `ScrollTo()` now uses drag-based input injection instead of direct normalizedPosition manipulation
  - Automatically detects horizontal vs vertical scrolling based on ScrollRect configuration
  - Smart direction detection based on target position relative to viewport center
  - Supports diagonal scrolling for 2D scroll views (both horizontal and vertical enabled)
- Updated all documentation to reflect new `ActionExecutor` API

### Added
- `ScrollToAndClick()` - Scroll to target element and click it in one action

## [1.1.4] - 2026-01-27

### Changed

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-27

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Package folder renamed from `UITest` to `UIAutomation` - clearer naming
- **BREAKING**: New static `UIAutomation` class replaces `UITestBehaviour` base class
  - Use `using static ODDGames.UIAutomation.UIAutomation;` for access to all helpers
  - Tests are now plain `[TestFixture]` classes using `[UnityTest]` with `IEnumerator` and `UniTask.ToCoroutine()`
  - No more inheriting from MonoBehaviour - cleaner, more idiomatic Unity test pattern
- `UITestBehaviour` removed (was marked obsolete)

### Fixed
- **Near() spatial search bounds calculation** - Fixed incorrect text bounds when canvas has non-identity scale
  - Now uses `RectTransform.GetWorldCorners()` instead of `TransformVector()` for reliable world-space bounds
  - Fixes direction checks (Above, Below, Left, Right) failing on scaled canvases

## [1.0.53] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- Actually renamed `Search.Static()` to `Search.Reflect()` across all code, tests, and documentation (code changes were missing in v1.0.52)

## [1.0.52] - 2026-01-27

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `Search.Static()` renamed to `Search.Reflect()` - clearer naming for reflection-based access
  - `Search.Reflect("GameManager.Instance.Score").IntValue`
  - `Reflect("GameManager.Instance")` helper available in test classes

### Added
- **`Property()` dot notation** - Navigate nested properties with a single call
  - `Property("a.b.c")` is equivalent to `Property("a").Property("b").Property("c")`
  - Example: `Reflect("GameModeDrag.Instance").Property("loadedLevel.player.racingLine")`
- **`Deserialize(string json)`** - Deserialize JSON (Newtonsoft) and set as property value
  - Example: `Reflect("GameManager.Instance").Property("PlayerData").Deserialize(@"{ ""Name"": ""Test"" }")`
- **`Serialize(bool indented = false)`** - Serialize current value to JSON string (Newtonsoft)
  - Example: `var json = Reflect("Player.Instance").Property("Stats").Serialize(true)`
- **`Search.New<T>(string json = null)`** - Create new instance, optionally from JSON
  - Example: `var player = Search.New<PlayerData>(@"{ ""Name"": ""Test"", ""Health"": 100 }")`
- **`Search.New(string typeName, string json = null)`** - Create instance by type name (no generic needed)
  - Example: `var player = Search.New("PlayerData", @"{ ""Name"": ""Test"" }")`

## [1.0.51] - 2026-01-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: GameObject manipulation methods are now async with timeout support
  - `Disable()`, `Enable()`, `Freeze()`, `Teleport()`, `NoClip()`, `Clip()` now return `UniTask<T>` and require `await`
  - All methods wait up to 10 seconds (configurable via `searchTime` parameter) for elements to appear
  - Throws `TimeoutException` instead of `InvalidOperationException` when element not found
  - Consistent with other action methods like `Click()`, `ClickDropdown()`, etc.

## [1.0.50] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **GameObject manipulation methods on Search** - Direct methods on Search class for game object control:
  - `.Disable()` - Deactivate a GameObject (returns `ActiveState`)
  - `.Enable()` - Activate a GameObject, can find inactive objects (returns `ActiveState`)
  - `.Freeze(includeChildren)` - Zero velocity and set kinematic on Rigidbodies (returns `FreezeState`)
  - `.Teleport(Vector3)` - Move transform to world position (returns `PositionState`)
  - `.NoClip(includeChildren)` - Disable all colliders (returns `ColliderState`)
  - `.Clip(includeChildren)` - Enable all colliders (returns `ColliderState`)
- **Restoration tokens** - All manipulation methods return state objects that can restore original state:
  - `state.Restore()` - Manually restore to original state
  - `state.Count` - Number of affected components
  - Implements `IDisposable` for automatic restoration with `using()` pattern
  - Example: `using (Name("Player").NoClip()) { /* colliders disabled */ } // auto-restored`
- **Works on both UI searches and static paths**:
  - `new Search().Name("Player").Freeze()`
  - `Search.Static("GameManager.Instance.player").NoClip()`

## [1.0.49] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **`SetValue(object)` method** - Set property/field values via reflection:
  - Works with `.Property()` chain: `Static("...").Property("field").SetValue(value)`
  - Supports chained property access: `.Property("A").Property("B").SetValue(x)`
  - Works with indexers: `Static("...").Index(0).Property("field").SetValue(value)`
  - Example: `Static("GameManager.Instance").Property("isKinematic").SetValue(true)`

## [1.0.48] - 2026-01-16

### Removed
- **`Search()` helper method** - Removed from UITestBehaviour to allow direct access to `Search.Static()`. Use specific helpers instead: `Name()`, `Text()`, `Type()`, `Static()`, etc., or `new Search()` for advanced chaining.

## [1.0.47] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Indexer support for static paths and property navigation**:
  - `Search.Index(int)` method: `.Property("Items").Index(0)`
  - `Search.Index(string)` method: `.Property("Players").Index("Player1")`
  - C# indexer syntax: `.Property("Items")[0]` or `.Property("Dict")["key"]`
  - Inline indexer syntax in paths: `Search.Static("Game.Players[0].Name")` or `"Items[\"key\"]"`
  - Supports chained indexers: `Items[0][1]` or `Players["team"]["player"]`
- **Dot syntax for nested types** - Use `Search.Static("OuterClass.InnerClass.Property")` instead of `"OuterClass+InnerClass.Property"` for more readable paths
- **Right/middle mouse button support for drag operations**:
  - New `PointerButton` enum: `Left`, `Right`, `Middle`
  - All drag methods now accept optional `button` parameter (defaults to `Left`)
  - Example: `await Drag(new Vector2(100, 0), button: PointerButton.Right)`

## [1.0.46] - 2026-01-16

### Changed
- **`Sprite()` replaced with `Texture()`** - More comprehensive texture matching across all visual components:
  - Matches `Image.sprite.name`, `RawImage.texture.name`, `SpriteRenderer.sprite.name`
  - Matches all Renderer types: MeshRenderer, SkinnedMeshRenderer, ParticleSystemRenderer, LineRenderer, TrailRenderer, etc.
  - Searches material textures: `mainTexture`, `_BaseMap`, `_NormalMap`, `_EmissionMap`, and other common shader properties
  - Uses cached Shader property IDs for efficient texture property lookups
- **`Search.FindAll()` now searches all GameObjects** - Changed from RectTransform-only to Transform-based search, enabling search of non-UI objects like SpriteRenderers and MeshRenderers

### Removed
- **`Sprite()` search method** - Use `Texture()` instead, which provides the same functionality plus support for all renderer types

## [1.0.45] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Unity type value shortcuts** - New properties for common Unity structs:
  - `Vector3Value` - get Vector3 from static path or element transform
  - `Vector2Value` - get Vector2 from static path or RectTransform
  - `ColorValue` - get Color from static path or Image/Text color
  - `QuaternionValue` - get Quaternion from static path or transform rotation

- **Spatial positioning helpers** - Methods for checking element positions:
  - Screen-space: `ScreenCenter`, `ScreenBounds`, `IsAbove()`, `IsBelow()`, `IsLeftOf()`, `IsRightOf()`, `DistanceTo()`, `Overlaps()`, `Contains()`, `IsHorizontallyAligned()`, `IsVerticallyAligned()`
  - World-space: `WorldPosition`, `WorldBounds`, `WorldDistanceTo()`, `WorldIntersects()`, `WorldContains()`, `IsInFrontOf()`, `IsBehind()`

### Changed
- **`GetValue<T>()` now supports Unity types** - Direct cast for Vector3, Color, Quaternion, etc. before falling back to Convert.ChangeType

## [1.0.44] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **`Invoke()` and `Invoke<T>()` methods** - Call methods via reflection on static instances or UI element components
  - `Search.Static("GameManager.Instance").Invoke("StartGame")` - void method
  - `Search.Static("Player.Instance").Invoke("TakeDamage", 10f)` - with arguments
  - `Search.Static("Validator").Invoke<bool>("Validate", data)` - typed return value
  - Works on UI elements: `new Search().Name("Dialog").Invoke("Close")`

### Changed
- **Reflection methods now throw exceptions on failure** - `Property()`, `Invoke()`, `GetValue<T>()`, `StringValue`, `BoolValue`, `FloatValue`, `IntValue` now throw `InvalidOperationException` with informative error messages instead of silently returning null/default values. This ensures tests fail immediately with clear diagnostics when reflection operations fail.

## [1.0.43] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **`Click(GameObject)` clicking at wrong position** - Added `Click(GameObject)`, `DoubleClick(GameObject)`, `TripleClick(GameObject)` overloads to fix incorrect click position when clicking GameObjects directly (e.g., in `ClickScrollItems`)

### Changed
- **Drag operations now hold at start position** - All drag methods hold for 0.5s before moving (configurable via `holdTime` parameter)
- **Default drag duration increased to 1.0s** - Up from 0.3-0.5s for more reliable input processing
- **Default gesture duration increased to 1.0s** - Swipe, Pinch, Rotate, TwoFingerSwipe now default to 1.0s duration

### Added
- **`holdTime` parameter on all drag methods** - `DragAsync`, `DragToAsync`, `DragFromToAsync`, `DragSliderAsync` now expose `holdTime` parameter (default 0.5s)

## [1.0.42] - 2026-01-16

### Added

### Fixed
- **VisualTestRunner block execution** for non-Selectable elements - Now creates ElementInfo on-the-fly
- **Focus stealing in TestBuilder** - Editing fields no longer loses focus on value changes

## [1.0.40] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **`ClickDropdownItems()`** - Click each dropdown option sequentially
  - Automatically iterates through all options in a Dropdown/TMP_Dropdown
  - Optional `delayBetween` parameter for delay between clicks
  - Example: `await ClickDropdownItems(Name("Dropdown"), delayBetween: 500);`
- **`ClickScrollItems()`** - Click each item in a ScrollRect sequentially
  - Scrolls to each item before clicking to ensure visibility
  - Finds all Selectable children in the scroll view content
  - Example: `await ClickScrollItems(Name("Scroll View"));`

### Fixed
- **Null reference in TestBuilder** when chain item is null in VisualBuilder editor

## [1.0.39] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- **InputInjector verbose logs now gated behind DebugMode** - Reduces console noise during normal test execution
  - Logs like "InjectPointerTap at (x,y)", "Using mouse input", "MouseDrag start/end" now only appear when `UITestBehaviour.DebugMode = true`
  - Warning logs for missing devices remain visible at all times

## [1.0.38] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- **`Text()` now matches only the element with the text component** - Breaking change from v1.0.37
  - Previously `Text("Play")` would match a Button that had a child TMP_Text with "Play"
  - Now `Text("Play")` only matches the actual TMP_Text/Text element itself
  - Use `HasChild(Text("Play"))` or `HasDescendant(Text("Play"))` to match parent containers
  - Example migration: `new Search().Text("Submit").Type<Button>()` → `new Search().HasChild(new Search().Text("Submit")).Type<Button>()`
- **Action `Interval` reverted to 200ms** - Was 500ms in v1.0.37, now back to 200ms for faster test execution

## [1.0.37] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **`Text()` now matches only the element with the text** - Previously matched ancestors that contained text in children
  - `Text("Australia")` now only matches the TMP_Text/Text element itself, not parent ScrollArea
  - Fixes incorrect matches where `ClickAny(Text("X"))` would click on ancestor containers

### Changed
- **ActionExecutor logging now shows search query and element name** - Better debugging output
  - Format: `[ActionExecutor] Click(Text("Button")) -> 'ButtonText' at (450, 300)`
  - Shows what was searched for, what was found, and where the action occurred
- **Separated action delay from search polling** - `Interval` (200ms) for action delay, `PollInterval` (100ms) for search loops
  - Prevents flaky tests from actions being too fast while keeping searches responsive
- **Removed verbose debug logging from Adjacent search** - Cleaner console output

## [1.0.36] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **`Adjacent()` no longer matches label itself** - Excludes source text and its parent hierarchy from matching
- **`Adjacent()` uses alignment-aware scoring** - Prefers elements aligned with the label in the perpendicular axis
- **Flaky drag tests** - Added extra frame yield after drag operations for UI to process events
- **Unity serialization depth error** - Added `[SerializeReference]` to `SearchQuery.chain` and `SearchChainItem.search` to fix recursive serialization

### Changed
- **`Adjacent()` finds single nearest element** - Matches only the best-scoring adjacent element based on distance and alignment
  - Combined with other filters like `.Name()` or `.Type()`, requires both the adjacent match AND the filter to be true
  - Use `Near()` for filtering multiple elements in a direction

## [1.0.35] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **`Near()` no longer checks parent/child relationships** - Only uses screen-space positions for matching
  - Elements that contain the anchor text as a child now properly match based on screen position

## [1.0.34] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **`Near()` static helper in UITestBehaviour** - Can now use `Near()` as a starting point like `Text()` and `Name()`
  - `await Click(Near("Center Flag", Direction.Below).Text("Texture"));`
  - `await Click(Near("Settings"));`
- **Debug logging for `Near()` searches** - Logs element positions and direction checks to help diagnose search issues

## [1.0.33] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **Fixed `Near()` with direction filtering** - Now correctly matches all elements in the specified direction
  - `Near("Center Flag", Direction.Below)` matches ALL elements below the anchor text, ordered by distance
  - The first result from `Find()` is always the closest element
  - Combined with `Text()`, enables reliable selection of duplicates: `Near("Center Flag", Direction.Below).Text("Mask")`
  - Fixes regression from v1.0.32 where `Near()` was completely broken

### Changed
- **`Near()` behavior clarified** - Matches all elements in direction, orders by distance
  - `Matches()` returns true for ALL elements in the specified direction (not just the closest)
  - `Find()` returns results ordered by distance, so the closest element comes first
  - Use `First()` to ensure only the closest is selected: `Near("Label", Direction.Below).First()`

## [1.0.32] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- **Simplified `Near()` implementation** - BROKEN (fixed in v1.0.33)
  - Removes complex `IsNearestElementToText` check that was causing incorrect filtering
  - Results are ordered by distance to anchor text (closest first)
  - When combined with other filters like `Text()`, the closest matching element is returned first
  - Example: `Text("Mask").Near("Right Flag", Direction.Below)` returns all "Mask" elements below "Right Flag", closest first

## [1.0.31] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **`ActionExecutor` class** - Unified action execution layer for all test runners
  - UITestBehaviour, VisualTestRunner, and AIActionExecutor now share the same action execution code
  - Ensures consistent behavior across all test execution paths
  - Static async methods for all input actions (Click, Type, Drag, etc.)

### Fixed
- **`Near()` and `Adjacent()` with duplicate text labels** - Correctly handles UI with repeated text
  - When multiple text labels match (e.g., "Mask" under both "Center Flag" and "Right Flag" sections)
  - Now finds the closest matching anchor text to the candidate element first
  - Then verifies the element is the nearest to that specific anchor
  - Both query orderings work: `Near("Right Flag").Text("Mask")` and `Text("Mask").Near("Right Flag")`

### Removed
- **`SearchMethodTests.cs`** - Moved all tests to PlayMode tests in `SearchPlayModeTests.cs`

## [1.0.30] - 2026-01-13

### Changed
- **Extracted Search class to separate file** - `Search.cs` is now a standalone file for better organization
  - All Search functionality remains the same
  - Reduces UITestBehaviour.cs file size for easier maintenance

### Fixed
- **Two-finger gesture reliability** - Added extra frame yields after ending touch gestures
  - Fixes flaky `PinchAt` and `RotateAt` tests at off-center positions
  - Input System now has more time to process touch end states between gestures

## [1.0.29] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- **`Search.Near()`** - Distance-based proximity search for finding elements near text labels
  - `Search.Near("Center Flag")` - finds closest interactable to text using Euclidean distance
  - `Search.Near("Center Flag", Direction.Below)` - optionally filter by direction
  - More lenient than `Adjacent` - works with diagonal/offset layouts
- **`Search.HasSibling()`** - Filter elements that have a sibling matching criteria
  - `Search.ByType<Button>().HasSibling(Search.ByText("Label"))` - find buttons with a sibling containing "Label"
  - `Search.ByType<Button>().HasSibling("HeaderText")` - shorthand for name pattern

### Changed
- **Renamed `ByAdjacent` to `Adjacent`** - Removed "By" prefix for consistency
  - `Search.ByAdjacent("Label:")` → `Search.Adjacent("Label:")`
- **Renamed `Adjacent` enum to `Direction`** - Clearer naming, avoids conflict with method
  - `Adjacent.Right` → `Direction.Right`, `Adjacent.Below` → `Direction.Below`, etc.
- **Renamed target transform methods** - Added "Get" prefix for clarity
  - `Parent()` → `GetParent()` - transforms result to parent
  - `Child(index)` → `GetChild(index)` - transforms result to child at index
  - `Sibling(offset)` → `GetSibling(offset)` - transforms result to sibling at offset
  - These are distinct from filter methods like `HasParent()`, `HasChild()`, `HasSibling()`

## [1.0.28] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **Keyboard input injection** - Keys now properly re-queue state each frame during hold for reliable detection
- **Mouse/touch hold injection** - Added missing `InputSystem.Update()` calls for consistent event processing
- All input injection methods now call `InputSystem.Update()` after state changes

### Changed

- `UITestInputEvents` sibling counting now correctly counts only siblings with the same name (matches `UITestInputInterceptor` behavior)

### Changed
- All recording components now use centralized `UITestSettings` instead of scattered EditorPrefs
- Standardized all EditorPrefs keys to use `ODDGames.UITest.*` prefix
- Removed hardcoded Gemini model - now configurable via settings

## [1.0.20] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- Menu item "Create Test Recorder" moved to `Window/Analysis/UI Automation/` for consistency with other menu items

## [1.0.19] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- TouchPhase injection now uses enum values directly (fixed `ArgumentException: Expecting control of type 'UInt16'`)
- Gesture methods (`Pinch`, `Rotate`, `TwoFingerSwipe`) now use `Find<Transform>` to work with both UI and 3D objects
- `PanelSwitcher` now finds inactive 3D objects using `Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll<Transform>()`
- `DoubleClick` signature simplified with consistent parameter ordering

### Changed
- Standardized debug logging across all gesture methods (removed verbose internal logs)
- `RotateAt` refactored to remove redundant calculations
- Sample `GestureCube` added for 3D gesture demonstrations
- Sample `GestureTargetUI` added for UI gesture demonstrations

## [1.0.18] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- `Find<RectTransform>` and other non-Behaviour component types now work correctly
- Drag and drop operations can now find elements properly
- `ClickDropdown` now supports both legacy `Dropdown` and `TMP_Dropdown` components
- `ClickDropdown` uses more robust item finding (handles different Unity naming patterns)

### Added
- `DragTo(source, target)` - Drag one element to another for drag-and-drop testing
- `ClickDropdown(name, index)` - Select dropdown option by index using realistic clicks
- `ClickDropdown(name, label)` - Select dropdown option by label text using realistic clicks
- `ClickSlider(name, percent)` - Click slider at percentage position (0-1)
- `DragSlider(name, fromPercent, toPercent)` - Drag slider between positions
- `DoubleClick(name)` - Double-click an element
- `Scroll(name, delta)` - Scroll wheel input on an element
- `Swipe(name, direction)` - Swipe gesture helper (Left, Right, Up, Down)
- `Pinch(name, scale)` - Two-finger pinch gesture (scale < 1 = pinch in, scale > 1 = pinch out)
- `TwoFingerSwipe(name, direction)` - Two-finger swipe gesture
- `Rotate(name, degrees)` - Two-finger rotation gesture
- `DraggableUI` and `DropZoneUI` sample components for drag-and-drop demos
- `PanelSwitcher` component for sample scene navigation

### Changed
- Simplified `ComprehensiveSampleTest` for faster execution
- Removed EzGUI support (moved to separate package)
- Removed verbose iteration logging from Find method
- Gesture methods (`Swipe`, `Pinch`, `TwoFingerSwipe`, `Rotate`) now use screen-relative percentages instead of fixed pixels for device independence
- Added `fingerDistance` and `fingerSpacing` parameters to gesture methods for customization

## [1.0.17] - 2025-01-07

### Fixed
- `TextInput` now works with TMP_InputField by using direct text property injection (character-by-character)
- Sample scenes use TMP_InputField instead of legacy InputField for proper Input System compatibility

## [1.0.16] - 2025-01-07

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed EZ GUI support**: The `HAS_EZ_GUI` conditional compilation and all EZ GUI/AnB UI SDK integrations have been removed

### Changed
- `TextInput` now uses Input System injection (click to focus, type characters, optional Enter)
- Reduced debug logging verbosity (removed per-frame Find/injection logs)
- Simplified test runner context menus (removed popup dialog)

### Added
- `KeyPressTest` sample for keyboard input testing
- Context menu options: Run Test, Run Test (Clear Data), Run Test with Data Folder/Zip

## [1.0.15] - 2025-01-07

### Breaking Changes
- **Requires Unity Input System**: Projects must now use the Input System Package (New) - legacy Input Manager is no longer supported

### Changed
- Restructured repository: package content now in `package/` subfolder for proper UPM git URL references
- Click/Hold/Drag now use Unity Input System injection for reliable UI event handling
- Sample scenes now use `InputSystemUIInputModule` instead of `StandaloneInputModule`
- Replaced Odin Inspector dependency with `[ContextMenu]` attribute

### Added
- Test Unity project in `test/` folder for framework development
- `ClickFeedback` component for visual click confirmation in samples
- Input System as package dependency (required)
- PressKey/PressKeys methods for keyboard input simulation

### Fixed
- Input System clicks not reaching UI elements (was using wrong input module)

## [1.0.7] - 2025-01-05

### Added
- Sample tests demonstrating UITest framework capabilities
  - BasicNavigationTest - menu navigation patterns
  - ButtonInteractionTest - clicks, toggles, indexes, repeats, availability checks
  - FormInputTest - text input, dropdowns, sliders, form submission
  - DragAndDropTest - scrolling, swiping, drag-and-drop
  - PerformanceTest - framerate monitoring, scene load timing
- SampleSceneGenerator editor tool (UITest > Samples > Generate All Sample Scenes)
- Assembly definitions for Samples module

## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-16

### Added
- Initial package release
- Core UITestBehaviour base class with async test support
- UITestAttribute for test metadata (Scenario, Feature, Story, Severity, etc.)
- Recording system for capturing UI interactions
- Test generator for creating test code from recordings
- Editor toolbar integration for recording
- UITestRunner for batch test execution
- Assembly definitions for proper code organization
- README documentation

### Supported Projects
- MTD (Monster Truck Destruction)
- TOR (Trucks Off Road)
